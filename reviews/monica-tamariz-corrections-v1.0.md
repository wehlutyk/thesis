Corrections requested to version 1.0 of the manuscript.

p. 11. Please explain why you think the lack of ecological validity is a downside. You could argue that the whole field of laboratory psychology is based on similarly 'non-ecologically valid' studies, and yet it has yielded enormous amounts of knowledge. 

p.11. Regarding your sentence starting "In particular, we shall see that the exact definition of (...) a cultural attractor...." : Please explain why attractors cannot be defined a priori (perhaps at multiple levels), and then tested experimentally.

p.12. Re. your sentence "We describe the detailed (...) is overall evolution of utterances is compatible with the existence of an attractor at the lexical level": Attractors are one theory compatible with evolution of utterances; however, Croft "Utterance selection theory (Croft 2000) is equally compatible, and has been argued and tested with formal models validated by data (see work by Blythe, Croft and others). Please comment on this: "being compatible with" does not mean "supporting".

p.13, last paragraph: Please give references for "Most definitions of culture".

p. 14, section 1.1.2. Please give references for (a), (b) and (c). 

p. 14, last line: please briefly describe what "environmental engineering" is.

p.16, regarding "not an ontological claim about the nature of what exactly is being transmitted". Boyd and Richerson are completely clear that culture is mental (e.g. Boyd & Richerson 2005, p.4 definition, and subsequent pages and sections; please acknowledge.

p. 17, on Sperber's cultural representations: please give Sperber's definition of cult. repr. (not only examples).

p. 19. Change "apes" to "monkeys" (baboons are not apes).

p. 23-24. I'd move Cornish, Smith & Kirby (2013) and Tamariz & Kirby 2015 from section on language change to contemporary revival (there is no language there, only sequneces of colours and drawings, respectively, no meaning or communication tasks involved).

p. 25. Together with Scott-Phillips & Kirby 2020, Tamariz & Kirby 2016, please Please cite Tamariz 2017, Annual Review of Linguistics long review of experimental approaches to cultural language evolution.

p. 28. An additional framework: the level of genes affects the level of language, but this effect is mediated and modulated by the level of culture (Kenny Smith, Simon Kirby) please acknowledge.

p. 29. "These questions resonate with recent debates..." Please give references.

p. 29, typo: "principle heritable material" --> "principal heritable material".

P. 30, why don't you go into detail about Developmental Systems Theory, which could be as relevant to cultural evolution as e.g. Niche construction theory? Please justify a bit more.

p. 34, last paragraph, please state that the 4 questions mentioned will be addressed in the following subsections (I spent a couple of minutes looking for the 4 questions written somewhere!)

p. 35, "if we find constancy and gradual change (...) and no clear copying behaviour of agents" . Please justify why you say that we don't find clear copying behaviour of agents, and at least superficially review the literature on social learning (McGuigan, Flynn, Whiten, etc, and chapter 3 of Boyd & Richerson 1985).

p. 36. Your emphasis is on culture relying on ostensive communication; however, much culture is transmitted without such ostensive communication. (Personally I'd go as far as saying that communication is most relevant to one domain of culture - language - and to one transmission mechanism - teaching - but not to others). Taking into account the social learning literature (see previous comment) please comment on the relationship between cultural transmission and communication.

p. 38. On attractors.  Please highlight the differences (if any) between Sperber's attractors and Croft's replicators. The latter also fulfill the conditions exposed in the paragraph starting "As we shall see...". Could attractors be the winning variants in an evolutionary selection process such as that proposed by SCE?

p. 41. Please justify a bit more why you say quotations should not change as they spread. Take into account that they are used by internet users, in context, for their own purposes (which may not necessarily be "be faithful").

p. 44. Continuing from my last comment, under "2.3 Methods" you say it is "safe to assume that the variation is due to involuntary cognitive biases". I would challenge that, for the reasons given above.

p. 68. You mention two data collection methods: web and smartphone experiments and experimental web applications; I'd add Mechanical Turk as a third source, which several recent studies have used.

p. 71 A procedure section explaining the task as viewed from the participant would be useful.  Also, say somewhere that each participant saw all the utterances (it is not clear whether each participant saw one utterance or more than one, until much later)

p. 71 Also, please explain how you dealt with ethics (how participants gave informed consent, etc).

p. 74. There is no figure 3.3. Please amend.

p. 82, last line, typo: alvays --> always.

p. 85, sentence beginning "A classic effect of transmission chains..." Please give references.

p. 87 (this comment applies to the whole Results section in this chapter): why don't you apply statistical tests --mixed effects linear models would be appropriate-- to establishing the strength of effects? E.g. paragraph starting "This measure gives a sense..." We want more than a sense, please quantify divergence, and don't say "sublinear", but give a more precise characterisation of the evolution, with stats tests. (Or justify why you don't use tests).

p. 87. (This also applies thoughout results sections here and in chapter 4). For the calculation of 95% C.I. you assume each slice is independent, but THEY ARE NOT INDEPENDENT!.  Please acknowledge.

p. 89, last line, and footnote 19. What corpus did you use to calculate the vector representations? How large was the corpus? How large was the cooccurrence window?

p. 97, typo: "a deletion); The" --> "a deletion). The"    (change semicolon to full stop)

Results section. Discuss a little bit the possibility of analysing grammatical transformation and what they would tell us.

p. 103, last sentence on page. Please explain what "regularising" means in this context.

p. 117. Please justify your use of the expression "punctuated equilibrium". Beyond the fact that changes are clustered over time, what is the connection with P.E. as defined for biological evolution? Any mechanistic similarity? Any other analogies?

p. 118. You speak of "long regularisation". Please connect this to the mechanism of "reanalysis" in language change.

p. 119, referred to the whole chapter: You focus on transformations, please acknowledge that a much larger proportion of the utterance content was trainsmitted faithfully than transformed.

Related to results from chapters 2 and 3: you find transformations directed towards simplicity (ease of learning/reproduction). This is what Kirby Tamariz Cornish & Smith (2015) predict for reproduction tasks such as yours. If you'd added a communication task, simplification would not be predicted. Please acknowledge this general interpretation of your results.

p. 121, sentence starting "This has led us to identify....". Yes, consistent with CAT, but also with other approaches, notably Croft's and Kirby's. Please acknowledge.

p. 121, second paragraph, please refer to linguistics' concepts of speaker meaning and semantic meaning and give references.

p. 122. You announce you will "propose speculation on practical approaches...". Please explain why you limit yourself to speculation and why you do not, instead, propose concrete, testable hypotheses that will help assess the validity of theories.

p. 122, paragraph starting "The path we took so far...". It would be useful here, again, to have a clear definition of attractors.

p. 123, footnote 2. In a paper, it would make sense to leave out these extra analyses, but in a PhD it would have been worth including them. It sounds from this note that you did not include them in the thesis because you didn't find what you expected; with more reason, then, you should have included them and discussed their implications.  If you have time I encourage you to add this and discuss.

p. 123-124. The processes illustrated under 4.2.2. Challenges, and what you call 'regularisation' are , again, very related to reanalysis, a concept used in linguistics, involved in language change (Langacker 1977, Harris & Campbell 1995). Please mention and reference.

p. 127. "what aspect of the meaning should one vocus on when examining its evolution to identify attractors?"  This sentence, for me, makes the inclusion of a definition of attractor essential. Are attractors mental representations? Could word-forms be attractors?  Is the reason that attractors have been considered to be mental representations that you write this chapter? Are attractors = meanings? Please clarify.

p. 127, "As a consequence, an approach to pragmatics....". The empirical studies and resulting data in chapters 2 and 3 do not allow you to say anything about meanings. I see a disconnect between chapters 2 and 3 on one hand and this chapter on the other. Why are you talking about meaning now, when meaning was totally absent from the empirical chapters?  I would expect, after this chapter, an empirical approach that includes meaning. Please jusrify why you don't do this.

p. 141. "Now as regards language itself...". Reading this raises the following evolutionary-relevant question: What is it that humans have (but not other apes) that make us able to reach the languaging phase?

p. 144, second paragraph. Why do you propose to reduce dimensions to 2? So that they can be plotted on paper (is this a good reason)? 

p. 144, third paragraph. You are proposing a meaning similarity metric; however, if you say that meaning is context dependent, with this data you have no possibility of measuring meaning or meaning similarity in any way, since you only have access to data.... Please comment.

p. 146, first paragraph. The data you would obtain with this in vivo approach is nevertheless public, you still do not have access to the meaning in people's minds. Please comment.

p. 149. Please specify more clearly what evidence you have found for the existence of attractors with your empirical work in this thesis.
