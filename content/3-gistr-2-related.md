  * *Missing information*: most blog and media outlet authors do not quote their source when they publish a quote online (it's often not relevant to the article), meaning there are no source-destination links in the data collected; this information must instead be inferred anew to study the evolution of content. There is also no access to author information (gender or age, experience in writing, but also psychological factors like memory span), ruling out any study of individual author effects in transforming the content.
  * *Missing context*: the lack of access to the context of production and reception of quotes makes it impossible to interpret what a quotation means to its author or its reader [@wittgenstein_philosophical_2010; @briggs_mazes_1992; @cuffari_participatory_2014]. Analysing any kind of semantic evolution is therefore out of reach for this kind of passively collected online data [@lerique_2016, to be published].
