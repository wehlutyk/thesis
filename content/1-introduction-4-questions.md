## Current questions {#sec:intro-problems}

Moving back into the core of the cultural evolution framework put forth by Californian and Parisian cultural evolution, we can now focus on outstanding questions for current and future research.
We identify four such questions, which far from exhaust the possibilities, but give nonetheless an overview of the most actionable or central issues in the field.
The empirical work presented in this thesis is concerned with only one of these questions, namely the study of empirical attractors, and the transformations they emerge from, in the special case of linguistic utterances.
However, the matter is not independent from the other three questions, and a second goal of this section is to show why it is worthwhile to focus on this particular subject, even though it does not appear as the most important one at first sight.


### Attraction versus source selection

The Californian and Parisian research streams are built around two complementary processes:
attraction and source selection.
Attraction is the umbrella phenomenon studied mostly under the Parisian approach, and is a central concept to explain cultural constancy and change when there is no clear copying behaviour (i.e. transmission is low-fidelity):
if we find constancy and gradual change in a given cultural domain in spite of interpretation, rich effects of psychology, cognitive biases, interaction, and no clear copying behaviour of agents, then cultural attraction might be a good candidate to explain its evolution.
In itself, finding a cultural attractor is not an explanation, but an indication that the transmission biases are interacting in such a way that the state of culture is maintained in spite of important changes in micro-level transmission events.
Source selection, on the other hand, is the umbrella process studied mostly under the Californian approach, and is an explanatory factor in domains that feature copying behaviours (i.e. when transmission is high-fidelity):
when agents copy traits, or attempt to copy them, with for instance conformity, prestige, or content biases, then evolution can be usefully explored by looking at the way agents select the sources from which they copy, and the differential spread that their selection entails.
Both source selection and attraction act on multiple scales, as cultural traits or elements can be copied and transformed on several dimensions that potentially interact.

As @acerbi_if_2015 note, attraction and source selection are not incompatible, as both are part of the overall cultural evolution process.
Given their multi-level nature, both processes can also be part of one another;
for instance, transformation at the level of a sentence can be analysed as selection at the level of words or concepts, or transformation of a language can be seen as selection at the level of utterance structures [@croft_evolutionary_2013].
@sterelny_cultural_2017 also notes that the Parisian and Californian research streams differ mostly in what they aim to explain.
For the Californians, the question is how humans managed to survive and develop successful practices in the face of an opaque environment (for instance poisonous plants that can become highly nutritive when adequately processed).
They explain this by appealing to cumulative cultural learning, which allows agents to learn from the practices of their preceding generation by copying and slightly modifying them in the process.
Some level of imitation or copy is crucial to this account, precisely because the opacity and the dangerousness of the environment makes the sort of self-confident experimenting one could observe without copy extremely risky.
For the Parisians, the question is why cultural traditions with no clear utilitarian value can exist, and evolve, aside from survival-related practices such as cooking techniques.
They argue that the evolution of such traditions crucially involves ostensive communication (where the recipient of the communication must recognise the intention behind the communicative act), which is fidelity-neutral but not content-neutral:
not all pieces of content are communicated equally, and successful communication only rarely entails copy.
The Parisians thus ask why, in the face of a low-fidelity process that introduces such variation at every step, some cultural elements maintain a level of constancy and keep being transmitted through time, thus becoming evolving traditions.

If the two approaches aim to explain different features of culture, one is entitled to ask in which domain each approach is the most appropriate.
As illustrated by the examples above, some domains involve mostly imitative behaviours and others mostly transformative, but there may also be domains that involve both imitation and non-copying communication in important degrees.
More broadly then, the goal here is to understand the dynamics of spread (for instance due to specific source-selection behaviours) in combination with the transformations of the content of items (for instance because of inferential communication), two processes which are likely to interact with each other.


### Interaction of cultural and genetic evolution

Opinions on the importance of gene-culture co-evolution dynamics vary widely.
To what extent do genetic and cultural evolution interact, and in which cases does cultural change drive genetic change?
Niche construction theorists, and more broadly the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis movement, have convincingly argued for the relevance of such interactions in some specific cases, such as lactose tolerance.
Proponents of the Californian approach to cultural evolution broadly agree with the niche construction perspective, considering that the cultural processes they study (concerned more with norms than with traditions *per se*) can have a long-term impact on the selective niche in which later generations develop.
In particular, one view has it that the centrality of cultural transmission in human beings created a selective pressure for transmission capacities themselves [@sterelny_cultural_2017], such that cultural evolution drove genetic changes that enhanced cultural transmission.
While CAT is broadly compatible with a gene-culture co-evolution account, and also discusses cases of constructed niches with downstream effects, @morin_how_2016 is not convinced that an impact of culture on genetic change is necessary to explain the emergence of global human traditions.
Indeed, he argues that faithful transmission itself is neither necessary nor sufficient to explain the diffusion of global traditions, and consequently that scenarios that do not involve genetic adaptation to imitation are just as plausible given the current evidence.

This question is intimately related to the relative importance of imitation and non-copying communication.
However, answers might also lie in the importance and exact nature of the cognitive niche described by @sterelny_minds:_2010:
how does the construction of such niches contribute to both ecological and psychological factors of attraction as the Parisian stream views them (e.g. through scaffolding of cognitive development)?
How can the process of niche construction be usefully modelled to test hypotheses on the feedback dynamics between different channels of inheritance?
Here too, much is open to explore, which leads us to the next two points:
formalisation and further development of empirical studies.


### Formalisation

Sperber argues that CAT should not aim to become a "grand unitary theory", a position which is well informed by the diversity of domains CAT seeks to explain, and the variety of dimensions that we find in each domain [@sperber_explaining_1996 p. 83].
Instead, CAT proposes a framework, a way of thinking that generates productive questions for the explanation of culture.
Nevertheless, the approach relies on two fundamental elements that provide some degree of unification.
First, Sperber insists on providing a clear ontology to the study of culture:
that of public and mental representations, the latter relying on cognitive science.
Second, part of CAT's argument for cultural attraction rests on the idea that much human communication is *ostensive* communication [@morin_how_2016, chap. 2], that is it works through the inference of communicative intentions, a process which involves a great deal of reconstruction and which has been studied at length by Relevance Theory [@sperber_relevance:_1995;@wilson_relevance_2004].
Relevance Theory also integrates well with CAT, and the framework it develops is precisely an attempt to formalise the way agents select salient dimensions and implications of behaviours in concrete situations.
Given these two fundamentals, what prevents CAT from more formally exploring the way relevance-theoretic principles can predict the evolution of representations as described by Cultural Attraction Theory?
One could imagine formal models that establish the links between the types of situations in which a representation is interpreted and produced anew at the microscopic level, and the evolution that such representations will go through at the macroscopic level.
Such a model would be similar to the stylised phenomena identified by @boyd_culture_1985 for the case of imitative communication.
While some models do exist for specific cases [@claidiere_role_2007] or for the macro level [@claidiere_how_2014], no general formal model currently links the micro and macro levels in the Parisian research stream [@sterelny_cultural_2017 p. 49].

Part of the challenge, at least, is the formalisation of both representations and the context in which they are communicated and evolve.
While Relevance Theory proposes a way to deal with context, formalising representations themselves and their link to context is currently unheard of, and may remain so.
Indeed, Sperber notes that CAT's major contribution is not to solve this problem, but to make it manageable:

> "The epidemiological approach renders manageable the methodological problem raised by the fact that our access to the content of representations is unavoidably interpretive. The solution ... is merely to render more reliable our ordinary ability to understand what people like you, Opote or me say and think."
> [@sperber_explaining_1996 p. 53]

Sperber

"The epidemiological approach renders manageable the methodological problem raised by the fact that our access to the content of representations is unavoidably interpretive. The solution to this methodological problem of ethnography is not to devise some special hermeneutics giving us access to representations belonging to a culture, yet uninstantiated in the individual heads or the physical environment of its members. The solution is merely to render more reliable our ordinary ability to understand what people like you, Opote or me say and think. This is so because, in an epidemiological explanation, the explanatory mechanisms are individual mental mechanisms and inter-individual mechanisms of communication; the representations to be taken into account are those which are constructed and transformed by these micro-mechanisms. In other words, the relevant representations are at the same concrete level as those that daily social intercourse causes us to interpret." (p. 53)

So it really isn't a reductionism, but a "bridging the gaps" between approaches.

"The kind of naturalism I have in mind aims at bridging gaps between the sciences. not at universal reduction. Some important generalizations are likely to be missed when causal relationships are not accounted for in terms of lower-level mechanisms. Other valuable generalizations would be lost if we paid attention to lower-level mechanisms only. If we want bridges, it is so as to be able to move both ways." (p. 98)

"The psychological features pertinent to determining types of cultural things may well include features of their content. Of course, content features can be characterized only interpretively. To say that various representations share a content feature amounts to saying that they can all be interpreted, at a given level and from a given point of view, in the same way. Still, that property of common interpretability, with all its vagueness, may suffice, if not to describe, then at least to pick out, a class of phenomena all affected by some identical causal factors." (p. 54)

Sperber thus suggests that models will necessarily have to outsource their account of the content of representations:

> "To say that various representations share a content feature amounts to saying that they can all be interpreted, at a given level and from a given point of view, in the same way. Still, that property of common interpretability, with all its vagueness, may suffice, if not to describe, then at least to pick out, a class of phenomena all affected by some identical causal factors."
> [@sperber_explaining_1996 p. 54]

And indeed, models need not provide a general account of representations to be useful, as existing models already bring insight to cases in which the content of representations is interpreted beforehand [see again @claidiere_role_2007].
A more general modelling effort, however, faces the problem of generally accounting for representations and their interpretation context:
on one side, the value of CAT lies principally in recognising that, because of complex psychological processes, the content of representations changes in important ways when it is transmitted.
On the other side, a model that does not formalise representations and their interpretation context will only allow a limited set of predefined transformations to be accounted for.
Thus an account of the content of representations, as well as the context in which they are interpreted, must be part of any general formal model that does not empty the approach of its substance.
Classical cultural evolution, to the contrary, rests on imitative processes, such that models can avoid having to define the exact nature of a cultural trait and can instead focus on its frequency or spread in a population, without having to worry too closely about mutation.
Not so for CAT:
a meaningful model of cultural attraction must account for representations and their transformations, up to a degree, but in a sufficiently general way to (1) elicit effects due to the added ingredient of transformation, and (2) be applicable to different contexts.
@claidiere_role_2007 and @claidiere_how_2014 have developed the first steps of such an approach, with predefined discrete or continuous one-dimensional representation spaces that already show that attraction can create behaviours not accounted for by imitation-only models.
The next step, however, is much higher, and is likely to involve a simple version of Relevance Theory, that is on one side an account of the multi-dimensional aspect of representations, and on the other side a mechanism for agents to sieve through that added complexity.

While such an endeavour seems quite ambitious given the current state of modelling, it would provide a well-defined playing field to confront accounts of cultural evolution and especially the theories of cognition on which they are based.
Indeed, we saw previously that defining the cognitive level of cultural evolution in terms of representation processing (a view shared by CAT and Relevance Theory) is not the only option on the market;
one could imagine, for instance, a modification of CAT where the cognitive-level processes have been swapped out in favour of an enactive account of interactions.
Indeed, that approach is also developing a description of the way organisms make sense of their world, a description which can come to replace or be combined with the information-processing account of organisms selecting and inferring relevant information in their communications.

Overall, modelling CAT has not yet been pushed to its limits, and for good reasons:
the challenges involved are considerable.
To our knowledge however, a formal integration of CAT and Relevance Theory has not yet been attempted.
Doing so would be a promising step in the confrontation of approaches that genuinely compete for accounts of the interaction of cultural evolution and cognition.
In the meantime however, the empirical investigation of cultural attractors is a workable task that has much to bring to these theoretical questions.


### Empirical attractors

Reliably defining and observing phenomena that qualify as cultural attractors in real life can be challenging, first and foremost because of the multi-dimensional nature of culture, representations, and attraction, and second because the definition of what counts as a cultural trait is not settled [@acerbi_if_2015 p. 494].
Should one focus on mental processes, on artefacts, or on both?
At what descriptive level of artefacts or representations does one consider a transformation to be a meaningful cultural change, worthy of being included as an instance of cultural attraction?
Take the much debated example of Cinderella:
any telling of that story will differ from other instances on dozens of features, which could all be taken to be significant in a particular context.
A change in prosody or in the choice of words might alter the overall feel of the story, but not its narrative structure.
A change in narrative style or structure, or an instantiation of the characters in a modern setting, might completely change the face of the story while maintaining the "persecuted heroine" aspect that tale classification systems attribute to Cinderella.
Telling the tale in a particular context or to certain people only, say as an intimate bed-time story for one's child versus as a political metaphor in public discourse, can dramatically change the way it is received by its listeners.
Looking for the information encoded in a version of the tale, as it were, or the representation it can elicit, only serves to postpone the problem one step further.
As noted above, the nature of these effects is well recognised by CAT, and one way of tackling them could be using Relevance Theory.
Nevertheless, treating this diversity in an empirical study, even if it is only by classifying levels to evaluate their isolated relevance, is very much an open question [even though @acerbi_if_2015 note that similar multi-level indetermination of the unit of analysis is also found in the study of genetics].

As we shall see, identifying a cultural attractor in a specific domain also opens the question of the feedback loops it emerges from or participates in.
Indeed an attractor is expected to have effects on the ecological context from which it arises, since it changes the distribution of representations people are exposed to.
When psychological and ecological factors are involved in the emergence of the attractor, feedback effects are to be expected.
How does an attractor participate to or transform its own context?
In which cases is that retroaction a factor in the emergence of the attractor, versus a side-effect?
For long-lived attractors, is this process a form of niche construction?

Second, the scope of the phenomena to measure makes practical data collection also quite challenging.
Existing methods can be divided into the meta-analysis of large bodies of historical and anthropological works, laboratory transmission chains or micro-societies, and the analysis of digital traces, especially from social networks.
The expertise necessary to uncover reliable patterns using each of those methods makes higher integration a demanding task.
Nonetheless, there is much to gain by articulating these paradigms together, individually pushing them beyond their current limitations, and connecting them to studies in cognitive science.
Developing empirical methods is an integral part of any theoretical endeavour, and creating better observation tools is a sure path to push theoretical issues forward and to open previously unavailable questions to exploration [@greenwald_there_2012].

More generally, fleshing out the predictions that attraction makes in specific empirical cases and developing methods to test those situations will help bring the ideas underpinning CAT into sharper focus.
Much more empirical application is needed to evaluate the framework, and only such extensive testing in varied domains will determine how fruitful that approach is for the study of cultural evolution.

The present thesis aims to contribute to this project.
In the following chapters, I will present two empirical projects aimed at testing for the presence of attractors in a particular case:
the evolution of short linguistic written utterances.
The practical goals throughout this work have been (1) to combine disconnected but complementary disciplines to improve on current empirical techniques, and (2) to explore dimensions in which those techniques can be pushed beyond existing limitations.
In doing so, we shall also face the tension between two general approaches.
On one side, *in vivo* studies use passively collected, ecological data, and must face the full complexity of reality plagued with external factors.
On the other side, *in vitro* (laboratory) studies control most of the situation in which their data is generated, but are hostage to those same conditions;
in particular, it is often necessary to give a task---or something much like it---to participants of a laboratory study, making any results dependent on the implications of the task.
The work I present has two additional final goals:
\(1) contribute to the empirical evaluation of CAT as a theory of the interactions of culture, evolution, and cognition, in the form of the data points that I was able to collect;
\(2) highlight outstanding questions that are in need of more attention to make progress in the understanding of those interactions, thanks to a discussion of the costs handled and opportunities navigated by empirical work in the linguistic domain.
