### 20th Century

Social science has concerned itself with the stability, temporal evolution, and spatial variations and regularities of cultures since the very start of its discipline.
The question of how culture and psychology mutually influence each other, and how best to describe those influences, has correspondingly created much debate throughout the 20th century.

Ã‰mile Durkheim already, in his seminal study [-@durkheim_suicide:_2012], analysed the regularities of suicide rates over the years, and the correlation of those rates with a partition of society into certain social groups (in his case, different religious traditions).
The continuity of suicide through time and the links between suicide rate and social group, he argued, suggest we should study suicide as a *social fact*: an emergent phenomenon with a causal life at the level of other emergent social phenomena and, in particular, a phenomenon that effects individual psychology.
Investigating the mechanisms of such an effect, the reciprocal influences they have with psychology, and the role they play in shaping the stability and evolution of culture, became a central question for 20th century social science.
