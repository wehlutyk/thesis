#### Social science

Social science has concerned itself with the stability, temporal evolution, and spatial variations and regularities of cultures since the start of its discipline.
Émile Durkheim already, in his seminal study [-@durkheim_suicide:_2012], was looking at the regularities of suicide rates over the years, and the correlation of those rates with a partition of society into religion-related groups.
The continuity of suicide over time, and the links between suicide rate and social group, he argued, suggest we should study suicide as a *social fact*:
a phenomenon which, in spite of manifesting itself individually, has emerging properties in large groups, with a causal life at the level of other emergent social phenomena.
In particular, this emergent level has effects on individual psychology (one of Durkheim's aims was to establish the autonomy of sociology as a natural science of society).
By what mechanisms does such an effect operate, and what role does it play in shaping the stability and evolution of cultures?
Contemporaries of Durkheim, as well as later researchers, made this matter one of their central preoccupations.

But as those works also acknowledged, such a question raises issues in need of prior clarification:
what is the exact status of culture in relation to psychology, or even biology, and how separable are they?
Correspondingly, the question of how culture and psychology are part of one another and, if at all separable, how are the two related, or how best to describe the intermingling of these possible levels, has generated much debate throughout the 20th century.

@mauss_les_1936 initiated one approach to that issue, in his studies of the ways in which people of different societies, throughout history, use their bodies differently.
He noticed and began documenting the resting postures, the attitudes, the ways of walking, of swimming, or of sleeping, that different communities adopt, pass on to their offspring, and evolve through time.
His endeavour focused precisely on describing (parts of) culture as an embodied and physical property of life, incorporated through the everyday practices of a community, into which children grow by imitation, teaching, or other kinds of learning.
In this sense, he argued, there is no normal way of walking, there are only *ways* of walking:
by living with different bodily practices, different communities develop different bodies, none of which is standard.
Indeed most of these *techniques of the body* documented by Mauss play a role in the physiological development of people growing into them, with noticeable effects:
they will make one able to crouch for long periods of time or sleep while standing or horse-riding, and will also, Mauss argued for instance, change the silhouette of an adult body by influencing the way bones develop.
While such practices are undeniably linked to the physiology and to the history of communities, and in that sense are both biological and social, Mauss also asked what part psychology plays in their development, and what influence they have in turn on psychology:
he considered these practices complete *physio-psycho-sociological* phenomena.

The question of the incorporation of culture, and behind it the inseparability of culture, physiology, and psychology, has remained central in social science.
Works closer to us have contributed to the matter:
for @bourdieu_sens_1980, societal norms are also incorporated in perception, and shape our everyday unreflective interpretation of events, our way of navigating life (our *sens pratique*).
According to him, norms become embedded in the fullest sense, through life, into our low-level perception and exploration of the environment.
Together, incorporated norms form what he calls a person's *habitus*, a concept he puts at the centre of his theory of social reproduction, building on the idea that members of a society grow into a *habitus* leading them to perceive events in ways that reinforce existing power structures.

Social scientists often criticise Bourdieu's approach for not providing a satisfactory account of individual agency, as in this view it still seems opposed to structure acting as a constraint on action.
Another prominent approach, the *Theory of Structuration* from @giddens_constitution_1984, offers a more balanced way out of the tension between agency and structure (or norms), and in doing so reflects yet a different view of the relation between psychology and culture.
Acknowledging that approaches that conceive of structure as an external constraint on individual agency cannot resolve that opposition, Giddens (closer to the notion used in structuralist works) sees structure itself as a set of properties of social systems that bear an inherent duality, and cannot be meaningfully isolated from agency:
on one side, action arises by using existing structured resources, and its reliance on, or referring to, such structure is what makes it action (vs. noise);
on the other side, the production of action is a new reinforcement of the structure on which it relies.
This notion of structure is akin to Saussure's notion of linguistic structure, which in turn inspired the structuralist tradition in social science:
on one side, Giddens recalls, in producing an utterance we rely on incorporated syntactic rules;
on the other side, the production of a meaningful utterance contributes to maintaining language as a structured totality.

To someone coming from mathematics, such a discussion can be seen as stating the obvious: in a network, the parts' identities are defined by their position respective to the rest of the network, and the totality is made of the identities of the parts.
So necessarily any definition separating parts and totality will be recursive.
But the discussion does bear on the distinction between culture and psychology, which exists in academic disciplines.

Giddens, on the structure and agency debate
After the functionalists and the structuralists (orthodoxy that collapsed), and after the critics from hermeneutics that revive the Verstehen/Erklären debate
Double Hermeneutics and Teoría social informada hermenéuticamente
Theory of structuration: theory of the subject, without falling into subjectivism. Both subject (human agent) and object (society, institutions) are made in and of recurrent practices.
Describes a continuous process of action-monitoring, with unconscious components, and a conscience pratique, with a simplistic view of the cognitive, but there nonetheless.
Structure is what permits something to be emitted, and what results from the emission (e.g. in language.), which is the way to escape a dualism in explaining the relation of part to totality.

Authors from Anthropology and Sociology have produced countless other insights about these problems;
the miniature sample I exposed here represents the works which have most influenced the initial questions of this thesis.
Common behind the works of Mauss, Bourdieu, Giddens, and authors contemporary to each of them, lies a certain interest in eliminating biology-culture, nature-nurture, or substance-form dualisms which we routinely rely on in our conception of life.
This concern has remained central in contemporary social anthropology, and offers a valuable critique to the cultural evolution approach that I will focus on in what follows.
I will come back to this line of work in section \rn, and discuss it in more detail in chapter \rn.

### Evolution of culture

Today's discussion of the ties between culture and psychology is more influenced by proponents from cognitive science.
Inspired by the same initial analogy as darwinist authors from 20th century traditions, a new wave of analyses developed throughout the eighties and nineties and proposed a blend of (a) the gene-centred level of evolutionary theory, (b) insights that the application of generalised darwinian principles may (or may not, depending on the case) bring to the study of cultural change, and (c) a construal of the two processes of change, genetic and cultural, as parallel evolutions that actively interact, notably but not only through psychology.

@cavalli-sforza_cultural_1981 were the first to articulate this view in detail, by building on the fact that an evolutionary process need not be mediated by genetic transmission to take place.
Indeed [and following the synthesis provided by @lewontin_cultural_1982], the combination of (a) any transmission process leading to some nonrandom dependence of offspring phenotype on parent phenotype, (b) at least some variation of the phenotypes (against which to select), and (c) some differential survival and spread depending on phenotype, will lead to evolution by natural selection.
By looking at genetic models of evolution as a special case of those general principles of evolution, @cavalli-sforza_cultural_1981 developed the mathematical analysis of purely phenotypic transmission, which can take different paths in a given population:
vertical (from parent to offspring), oblique (from a non-parent member of the previous generation, to member of the next generation), or horizontal (inside one generation).
@boyd_culture_1985 [see also @boyd_origin_2005] further developed this line, leading to the formulation of *Dual Inheritance Theory* which offers a systematic analysis of some interactions between cultural and genetic evolution, an approach which is now vibrant with empirical work [see @acerbi_if_2015 for a review of recent studies].
A notable feature of this programme is that it does not constrain itself into a particular view of what culture is.
While the main authors do define culture as "information that people acquire from others by teaching, imitation, and other forms of social learning" [@boyd_origin_2005 p.3], a definition which at first sight might prove difficult to reconcile with a non-informational view of culture (such as the incorporated views from the previous section \rn), the mathematical models do not constrain the concept of culture as much.
The approach also has deep links with the analysis of *Niche Construction* [e.g. @odling-smee_niche_2003], which offers promising steps towards a reconciliation with non-informational views of culture stressing the importance of the development process in evolution.
I return to this subject in more detail in section \rn.

In the mid-nineties Dan Sperber formalised another approach to the question of the evolution of culture:
in a series of innovative articles gathered in @sperber_explaining_1996, the author puts forward a research programme called *Epidemiology of Representations* (better known today as *Cultural Attraction Theory*), and seeks to provide the cognitive and social sciences with a common framework with which to address interdisciplinary questions.
One of the guiding questions of Sperber's work is the following: how can we explain both the diversity culture across regions, and its relative stability through time, knowing that all human beings are more or less made of the same ingredients?
The framework he suggests starts from an ontology made principally of "mental representations", which correspond to those central to cognitive science, and "public representations", which are the expressions of mental representations in diverse cultural artefacts (pieces of text, utterances, pictures, building techniques, etc.).
For instance, I think of a melodic tune (mental representation), and I whistle it (public representation);
someone else hears it, and forms their own mental representation.
Most of the time, the new representation in that person's head is different from my original representation [@sperber_explaining_1996 p.25-26].
With this basis, Sperber proposes to see a human society as a large dynamical system of people constantly interpreting public representations into mental representations, and producing new public representations based on prior knowledge and what they have previously interpreted.
