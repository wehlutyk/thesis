#### Social science {#sec:intro-review-social}

Social science has concerned itself with the stability, temporal evolution, and spatial variations and regularities of cultures since the start of its discipline.
Émile Durkheim already, in his seminal study [-@durkheim_suicide:_2012], was looking at the regularities of suicide rates over the years, and the correlation of those rates with a partition of society into religion-related groups.
The continuity of suicide over time, and the links between suicide rate and social group, he argued, suggest we should study suicide as a *social fact*:
a phenomenon which, in spite of manifesting itself individually, has emerging properties in large groups, with a causal life at the level of other emergent social phenomena.
In particular, this emergent level has effects on individual psychology (one of Durkheim's aims was to establish the autonomy of sociology as a natural science of society).
By what mechanisms does such an effect operate, and what role does it play in shaping the stability and evolution of cultures?
Contemporaries of Durkheim, as well as later researchers, made this matter one of their central preoccupations.

But as those works also acknowledged, such a question raises issues in need of prior clarification:
what is the exact status of culture in relation to psychology, or even biology, and how separable are they?
Correspondingly, the question of how culture and psychology are part of one another and, if at all separable, how are the two related, or how best to describe the intermingling of these possible levels, has generated much debate throughout the 20th century.

@mauss_les_1936 initiated one approach to that issue, in his studies of the ways in which people of different societies, throughout history, use their bodies differently.
He noticed and began documenting the resting postures, the attitudes, the ways of walking, of swimming, or of sleeping, that different communities adopt, pass on to their offspring, and evolve through time.
His endeavour focused precisely on describing (parts of) culture as an embodied and physical property of life, incorporated through the everyday practices of a community, into which children grow by imitation, teaching, or other kinds of learning.
In this sense, he argued, there is no normal way of walking, there are only *ways* of walking:
by living with different bodily practices, different communities develop different bodies, none of which is standard.
Indeed most of these *techniques of the body* documented by Mauss play a role in the physiological development of people growing into them, with noticeable effects:
they will make one able to crouch for long periods of time or sleep while standing or horse-riding, and will also, Mauss argued for instance, change the silhouette of an adult body by influencing the way bones develop.
While such practices are undeniably linked to the physiology and to the history of communities, and in that sense are both biological and social, Mauss also asked what part psychology plays in their development, and what influence they have in turn on psychology:
he considered these practices complete *physio-psycho-sociological* phenomena.

The question of the incorporation of culture, and behind it the inseparability of culture, physiology, and psychology, has remained central in social science.
Works closer to us have contributed to the matter:
for @bourdieu_sens_1980, societal norms are also incorporated in perception, and shape our everyday unreflective interpretation of events, our way of navigating life (our *sens pratique*).
According to him, norms become embedded in the fullest sense, through life, into our low-level perception and exploration of the environment.
Together, incorporated norms form what he calls a person's *habitus*, a concept he puts at the centre of his theory of social reproduction, building on the idea that members of a society grow into a *habitus* leading them to perceive events in ways that reinforce existing power structures.

Social scientists often criticise Bourdieu's approach for not providing a satisfactory account of individual agency, as in this view it still seems opposed to structure acting as a constraint on action.
Another prominent approach, the *Theory of Structuration* from @giddens_constitution_1984, offers a more balanced way out of the tension between agency and structure (or norms), and in doing so reflects yet a different view of the relation between psychology and culture.
Acknowledging that approaches that conceive of structure as an external constraint on individual agency cannot resolve that opposition, Giddens (closer to the notion used in structuralist works) sees structure itself as a set of properties of social systems that bear an inherent duality, and cannot be meaningfully isolated from agency:
on one side, action arises by using existing structured resources, and its reliance on, or referring to, such structure is what makes it action (vs. noise);
on the other side, the production of action is a new reinforcement of the structure on which it relies.
This notion of structure is akin to Saussure's notion of linguistic structure, which in turn inspired the structuralist tradition in social science:
on one side, Giddens recalls, in producing an utterance we rely on incorporated syntactic rules;
on the other side, the production of a meaningful utterance contributes to maintaining language as a structured totality.

<!--

To someone coming from mathematics, such a discussion can be seen as stating the obvious: in a network, the parts' identities are defined by their position respective to the rest of the network, and the totality is made of the identities of the parts.
So necessarily any definition separating parts and totality will be recursive.
But the discussion does bear on the distinction between culture and psychology, which exists in academic disciplines.

\add{According to Sperber (1996 : 31), there's also the diffusionist program, which is a precursor to his approach}

Authors from Anthropology and Sociology have produced countless other insights about these problems;
the miniature sample I exposed here represents the works which have most influenced the initial questions of this thesis.
Common behind the works of Mauss, Bourdieu, Giddens, and authors contemporary to each of them, lies a certain interest in eliminating biology-culture, nature-nurture, or substance-form dualisms which we routinely rely on in our conception of life.
This concern has remained central in contemporary social anthropology, and offers a valuable critique to the cultural evolution approach that I will focus on in what follows.
I will come back to this line of work in @sec:intro-review-criticisms, and discuss it in more detail in @sec:discussion.

### Evolution of culture

Today's discussion of the ties between culture and psychology is more influenced by proponents from cognitive science.
Inspired by the same initial analogy as darwinist authors from 20th century traditions, a new wave of analyses developed throughout the eighties and nineties and proposed a blend of (a) the gene-centred level of evolutionary theory, (b) insights that the application of generalised darwinian principles may (or may not, depending on the case) bring to the study of cultural change, and (c) a construal of the two processes of change, genetic and cultural, as parallel evolutions that actively interact, notably but not only through psychology.

\add{? lewens-cultural-2012, p. 466, "Cultural evolutionists frequently begin their theorizing from a starting point that does not invite use of the meme concept, and may therefore appear neutral regarding its propriety. Their project is to integrate various forms of learning into evolutionary theory, in a way that leaves open the degree to which learning has anything in common with genetic inheritance.}


#### Californian

@cavalli-sforza_cultural_1981 articulated this view in detail, by building on the fact that an evolutionary process need not be mediated by genetic transmission to take place.
Indeed [and following the synthesis provided by @lewontin_cultural_1982], the combination of (a) any transmission process leading to some nonrandom dependence of offspring phenotype on parent phenotype, (b) at least some variation of the phenotypes (against which to select), and (c) some differential survival and spread depending on phenotype, will lead to evolution by natural selection.
By looking at genetic models of evolution as a special case of those general principles of evolution, @cavalli-sforza_cultural_1981 developed the mathematical analysis of purely phenotypic transmission, which can take different paths in a given population:
vertical (from parent to offspring), oblique (from a non-parent member of the previous generation, to member of the next generation), or horizontal (inside one generation).
@boyd_culture_1985 [see also @boyd_origin_2005] further developed this line, leading to the formulation of *Dual Inheritance Theory* (or DIT) which offers a systematic analysis of some interactions between cultural and genetic evolution, an approach which is now vibrant with empirical work [see @acerbi_if_2015 for a review of recent studies].
A notable feature of this programme is that it does not constrain itself into a particular view of what culture is.
While the main authors do define culture as "information that people acquire from others by teaching, imitation, and other forms of social learning" [@boyd_origin_2005, p. 3], a definition which at first sight might prove difficult to reconcile with a non-informational view of culture (such as the incorporated views from @sec:intro-review-social), the mathematical models do not constrain the concept of culture as much.
The approach also has deep links with the analysis of *Niche Construction* [e.g. @odling-smee_niche_2003], which offers promising steps towards a reconciliation with non-informational views of culture stressing the importance of the development process in evolution.
I return to this subject in more detail in @sec:intro-review-neighbours.


#### Parisian

\add{sperber is a bit paradoxical. He (1996, 3, 101 FN 29, 113, 124) relies a lot on Evolutionary Psychology, but at the same time is very open about the complexities of the social/cultural. But now, most authors agree that there isn't substantial disagreement with DIT, which is much less committed to EP.}

In the mid-nineties Dan Sperber formalised a second influential approach to the question of the evolution of culture:
in a series of innovative articles gathered in @sperber_explaining_1996, the author puts forward a research programme called *Epidemiology of Representations* (better known today as *Cultural Attraction Theory*, or CAT), and seeks to provide the cognitive and social sciences with a common framework with which to address interdisciplinary questions.
One of the guiding questions of Sperber's work is the following: how can we explain both the diversity culture across regions, and its relative stability through time, knowing that all human beings are more or less made of the same ingredients?
In developing an answer, Sperber commits himself to presenting a coherent ontology where the status of each object he refers to is well defined.

The framework he suggests then starts from an ontology made of "mental representations", which correspond to those defined and studied by classical cognitive science, and "public representations", which are the expressions of mental representations in diverse cultural artefacts such as pieces of text, utterances, pictures, myths, built structures, etc..
New mental representations are constantly formed in people's minds whenever they perceive or interpret public representations.
For instance, say I am thinking of a tune (mental representation), and I whistle it (public representation);
someone else hears it, and forms their own mental representation.
Most of the time, the new representation in that person's head is different from my original representation.
This last point is a defining feature of what Sperber proposes, in contrast to memetics of course, but also to DIT, outlined above [@sperber_explaining_1996, p. 25-26, 31].

On this basis, Sperber proposes to model human societies as large dynamical systems of people continuously interpreting public representations into mental representations, and producing new public representations through their situated actions (in which mental representations play a role).
To explain culture then, in this framework, is to analyse the processes by which representations circulate through a society, with different levels of change along the way.
Those processes are many and heterogeneous, which corresponds to the diversity of cultural domains that exist in societies, but the basic ontology remains grounded in the same mental representations of cognitive science.

By developing such an ontology to connect disciplines, Sperber proposes a credible bridge between the notions of representation in social science and that of mental representation in cognitive science, without reducing one area to the other or making simplistic assumptions about the phenomena encountered.
In this sense, his proposal is that of a naturalistic ontology for the study of culture which builds on cognitive science principles.
It is amenable to anthropology, and encourages the combination of the two bodies of knowledge in a well defined way.
Sperber can then rephrase interdisciplinary questions in terms of spread and transformation of representations.
For instance:
what types of representations are less transformed than others as people integrate them or perceive them, and produce them anew, making them circulate in a society?
Such representations, spreading wider than others, become *cultural representations* and will characterise a given society (for instance the habit of clothing, eating customs or values, or technological knowledge).

Why are those representations so stable, and how do they evolve?
Sperber introduces an additional concept to analyse this evolution:
the dynamical system which represents a society exhibits attractors, called *cultural attractors*, that depend on the complex interaction of psychological and ecological factors, and on the distribution of representations at a given moment in time [@sperber_explaining_1996, p. 106-118].
Cultural attractors are one of the core concepts in CAT providing intelligibility to the evolution of culture and to the reciprocal influence of psychology, culture, and environment.
As such, a key goal in the CAT research stream has been that of identifying existing attractors, and explaining their emergence based on the psychological and ecological factors that create them.

The most important intuition in Sperber's proposal, and what differentiates it from previous works, is the centrality of psychology for the evolution of culture [@sperber_explaining_1996, p. 31] and its role in the emergence of attractors.
He substantiates this by relying heavily on contemporary cognitive science, and in particular by adopting and extending the view of the modularity of mind initially defended by @fodor_modularity_1983 (his view goes further than Fodor's, as he argues for a *massive modularity of mind* applying not only to perception but also to conceptual processes).
Combining this view with epidemiology of representations, Sperber argues, results in a theory avoiding both the blank slate approach to psychology [@sperber_explaining_1996, p. 63-66] and a naive application of neo-darwinist formalism to the specific case of culture [@sperber_explaining_1996, p. 101], while still being able to account for the diversity of cultures [@sperber_explaining_1996, p. 120].
This specificity of CAT is often highlighted as one of the main differences with DIT [@sterelny_cultural_2017, p. 47];
CAT agrees nonetheless with the idea of gene-culture coevolution developed by DIT [@sperber_explaining_1996, p. 114], and most authors consider that both theories are compatible but have different core focuses [@sterelny_cultural_2017; @acerbi_if_2015].

The space opened by the development of DIT and CAT has generated much debate [see e.g. the peer commentary to @mesoudi_towards_2006] and some heated criticisms [@ingold_trouble_2007; @mesoudi_science_2007].
\add{lewens-cultural-2012, p. 461-2. and that paper for more discussion.}
@sec:intro-review-criticisms comes back to these debates and criticisms, which I group into two broad categories.
The first concerns the specifics of the evolutionary approach adopted by DIT and CAT:
what evolutionary mechanisms should they take into account (for instance niche construction, or epigenetic or extended inheritance) and, correspondingly, how long the restriction of inheritance to two isolated and parallel channels will remain the best approximation.
The second critique concerns what @thompson_mind_2007 has termed the "information dualism" of the notion of representation in cognitive science:
at the concrete level, it questions whether a representiationist approach is able to naturalise meaning, a core aspect in the analysis of culture and life;
at the programmatic level it suggests that, compared to a focus on dynamic couplings, a focus on representations in cognitive science has less heuristic value in guiding the exploration of the interactions between culture and psychology.
Regardless of whether proponents can reconcile DIT and CAT with the second critique, I believe both approaches can benefit greatly from these debates, and that empirical study has a crucial role to play in exploring the implications of each side.

The empirical exploration of CAT has proven a difficult task, for two main reasons.
First, Sperber clarifies that CAT is not, and should not be, a "grand unitary theory":

> "An epidemiological approach ... should not hope for one grand unitary theory. It should, rather, try to provide interesting questions and useful conceptual tools, and to develop the different models needed to explain the existence and fate of the various families of cultural representations." [@sperber_explaining_1996, p. 83]

Indeed, CAT accomplishes this:

> "What the epidemiological analogy suggests is a general approach, types of questions to ask, ways of constructing concepts, and a plurality of not too grand theoretical aims." [@sperber_explaining_1996, p. 61]

As a consequence, testing CAT means evaluating the fruitfulness of its paradigm.
No one study, or collection of studies for that matter, will reach a yes/no answer to the validity of CAT.
But we can reach a collective consensus about the usefulness of approaching the psychology-culture link with the tools and questions developed by that theory.

As the name CAT indicates, an important part of that toolbox is the notion of cultural attractor, which is amenable to empirical study:
the presence of a well-defined attractor in a given situation is a testable hypothesis, and approaching concrete domains from that angle can be more or less fruitful in inspiring studies and questions.
Now quantitative data on out-of-laboratory cultural artefacts is not easy to collect, which is the second reason empirical exploration is a challenge.
Although theoretical models to guide that exploration are gradually appearing [@claidiere_role_2007; @claidiere_how_2014], developing methods for the quantitative study of attractors is still an open problem.
Studies that can be explicitly linked to CAT involve an array of methods.
The meta-analysis of large numbers of anthropological or historical works has shown interesting results.
@morin_how_2013, for instance, shows how painted portraits change over the centuries to increasingly use direct-gaze (vs. oblique) portraying.
@miton_universal_2015 also used this technique to explain the historical success of the bloodletting practice, in spite of its medical ineffectiveness.
@baumard_increased_2015 fruitfully exploited similar records to tie the evolution of religious values to the affluence of societies in which they develop.
Morin and Miton (EHBEA 2017? \cn) model the evolution of heraldic coats of arms to test which hypotheses account best for the distribution of patterns and colours through time.
A second approach simulates rapid evolution of content in artificial spread and transmission experiments.
@claidiere_cultural_2014 explored the evolution of abstract visual patterns transmitted by apes;
@claidiere_argumentation_2017 also investigated the effect of argumentation on the transmission of solutions to simple but counter-intuitive reasoning problems.
\add{baumard-mutualistic-2013.}
A large number of other disciplines are developing diverse methods to study questions relevant to CAT and DIT.
I review these in greater detail in @sec:intro-review-neighbours.

While authors have acknowledged there is no core incompatibility between CAT and DIT [@acerbi_if_2015; @sterelny_cultural_2017] and a growing number of social scientists is discussing both approaches [see again the comments to @mesoudi_towards_2006; also @slingerland_what_2008], the work I present in this thesis is mainly focused on CAT itself, and less so DIT.
While the prevalence of the theory in the French academic landscape naturally had an impact on this choice, CAT is also interesting to focus on for more valuable reasons.
First, it puts cognitive science squarely in the middle of the problem, a focus I believe to be unavoidable.
Second, its initial goal is not so much to develop a mathematical theory of culture (which will surely continue developing), but to interest all disciplines studying human life in a common framework, by using *principled philosophical arguments*.
Third, this approach in turn leads to a crystal-clear articulation of the philosophical principles defended, discussed, or tested by the theory.
\add{it's not the clarity of hypotheses afforded by mathematics.}
\add{smaldino-let-2014.}
As such, it seems to me that CAT is in a good position to generate productive debate between alternative approaches which, for now, are still competing on the principled level (such as those discussed in @sec:intro-review-criticisms). \add{in particular social anthropology.}
In particular, the challenges that arise when attempting to study CAT experimentally, as is the case here for linguistic utterances, will prove helpful in developing a path to the resolution of the critiques faced by gene-culture coevolution approaches.


### Neighbouring areas {#sec:intro-review-neighbours}

A great number of disciplines and domains have developed interest in and contributed empirical studies to CAT.
Simulation and experimental studies of the evolution of morality [@baumard_mutualistic_2013], religion [@boyer_religion_2001], or reasoning [@claidiere_argumentation_2017; @mercier_why_2011] have used the theory, as well as studies on the emergence and evolution of language, or online content through digital media.
Those last two areas are the most relevant to the evolution of linguistic material, asking what kinds of factors can influence the evolution of content in a given domain, when do the changes build up cumulatively, or what role such accumulation plays in the long term evolution.
These studies use the serial reproduction paradigm and its derivatives extensively.


#### Bartlett's paradigm

The paradigm was initially introduced by @bartlett_remembering:_1995 as a variation of the repeated reproduction method (where each participant must recall the same item after increasing periods of time):
similar to a game of Chinese Whispers, the experimenter gives a first participant initial material (typically a picture or a short piece of text) with instructions to read or memorise it;
that participant is later asked to recall or reproduce the material, and the experimenter uses their output as input for the next participant, thus constructing a chain of successive memorisation (or perception) and recollection (or reproduction) of the initial material.
Important independent variables that may vary include the chain structure (e.g. the number and sources of preceding recollections a participant is exposed to), the reading or memorising instructions and context, the interval between exposition and recall, the possible task given during that interval (or, conversely, a possible overlap of exposition and recall, turning the task into copying), the recall instructions and context, the ordering and organisation of participants in the chain, or the ordering of the content itself in the chain (e.g. is a given participant exposed to material from a single generation of from random generations).
Typical studies will then analyse the trends in the transformations that occurred, possibly comparing across different chains;
if, as is often the case, the content itself is too complex to analyse systematically, studies often opt to contrast a simple measure (such as rate of change) for two different populations, two conditions in the independent variables mentioned above, or two minimally different types of content.
The method is the simplest instantiation of the causal chains of public representation to mental representation to public representation (and so on) described by @sperber_explaining_1996 [p. 99], and has thus garnered much attention in the literature related to CAT.

Earlier work, contemporary to Bartlett, already contributed much to the question.
@maxwell_remembering_1936 contrasted the evolution of a story containing deliberate inconsistencies in groups of different social status and age such as soldiers, priests, educated men or women, students, or boy scouts.
He found indications that different groups shortened the story at different rates, and conserved or transformed different pieces of the initial story.
@northway_influence_1936 also contrasted the conservation of story parts across groups of children from schools with different social backgrounds, relating the proportion of good recollections of a given item to the everyday activities of the children, or the types of transformations (addition, recasting, modification) to the different age groups, or to the diversity of backgrounds in a given group.
@ward_experiment_1949 later related a record of European coin types from 4th to 1st century B.C. to the trends obtained by Bartlett in serial reproduction of pictures, confirming that what Bartlett called "representative detached details", that is parts of a picture that represent a distinctive pattern or object even when isolated from the whole, are well preserved both in artificial and historical serial reproductions.
Ward thus suggests that comparing historical data to results of serial reproduction experiments can sometimes be a useful method to investigate the influence of universal-psychological versus local-cultural factors in theories of historical evolution of artefacts.
@hall_effect_1950 further explored hypotheses made by Bartlett on the effect of titles for pictorial and verbal serial reproduction:
in those new experiments, it appeared that titles had a considerable influence on the reproduction of both pictures and texts, by acting as an interpretive frame that guides (or confuses) the participants in interpreting the material.^[
  Hall also notes that such results have crucial political implications given the development mass media: "the function of the headline or title to some story or article is that of giving a particular emphasis to certain aspects of the text, and is one of the main methods of distorting and biasing what is remembered." [@hall_effect_1950, p. 120]
]
@gauld_experiments_1967, while still praising Bartlett for the progress his work represented compared to that of his predecessors, expressed a more critical stance on the reliability of serial reproductions experiments.
Indeed the authors showed that changing the exposition instructions, for instance by giving strict memorisation instructions, or by adding a simple sentence asking participants to be "accurate", will considerably reduce the transformation rate in the resulting chains, a fact that questions the effect measured by a setup without explicit memorisation instructions.
They also examined the level of conscientiousness of the participants in accomplishing their task, showing that it correlated negatively to the participants' transformation rate, thus suggesting that "errors could, it seemed, be avoided, if the subject was so inclined" [-@gauld_experiments_1967, p. 45] (this effect was not explained away by a measure of intelligence of participants), an issue that should be solvable by designing experiments that create an intrinsic motivation for participants to adopt the behaviour under study.
More recently, @kashima_recovering_2000 offered a reappraisal of Bartlett's contributions and his view of the interaction of culture and psychology, in the context of current social psychology and in relation to views of culture from social science such as those evoked in @sec:intro-review-social.
One recurrent problem, found across most of these studies, is the difficulty in quantitatively analysing meaning in the material [see the focus of @northway_influence_1936 on meaningfulness; @hall_effect_1950, p. 120; @gauld_experiments_1967, p. 42].
Instead, studies recur to analyses of form, survival, or other measurable aspects of the participants' productions (e.g. for linguistic material, the length of a recollection, the number of words, concepts, or propositions accurately recalled, or a contrast of the concepts conserved at the end of the chains).
This challenge still exists today, and current studies using meaningful material use the same fundamental techniques to get by (indeed, the studies presented here are no exception).
While much progress can be made by using these workarounds to quantifying aspects of the material, or by focusing on artefacts bearing no more semantic information than their physical appearance already display, it seems a consensual account of meaning, and a corresponding means of analysis, will be necessary for a full-fledged theory of cultural change to establish itself.
\change{should this last sentence go later?}


#### Contemporary revival

Probably owing to the development of DIT and CAT, the last two decades have seen a regain of interest for this setup (now known as a transmission chain) and its derivatives (generally known as cultural transmission experiments), resulting in the development of new case studies and methodologies.
Regarding the transformation that material undergoes, @bangerter_transformation_2000 showed for instance that in transmitting a scientifically styled account of human sexual reproduction, participants tended to personify ovum and sperm, and attribute stereotypical gender roles to them.
@mesoudi_hierarchical_2004 argued that the loss of detail observed in the transmission of reports of everyday events is due to a hierarchical encoding of memories, biasing participants' recollections in favour of higher-level descriptions.
Another line of research focuses on the effect of information being more or less counter-intuitive, a contrast that can help test the Minimal Counter-Intuitiveness theory of religion [@boyer_religion_2001].
Studies such as @barrett_spreading_2001 and @norenzayan_memory_2006 have thus devised linguistic material with varying degrees of counter-intuitiveness, and measured their differential transformation or conservation in transmission chain setups.
@purzycki_mci_2016 offers a valuable critical discussion of these works.
Other studies have focused on similar transmission advantages that certain types of information can have over competing types.
@kashima_maintaining_2000, for instance, studied the fate of stereotype-consistent and stereotype-inconsistent information in a story, highlighting a higher degradation rate of stereotype-inconsistent information, compared to stereotype-consistent, when that information is relevant to the story plot;
notably, the effect is not present in background information irrelevant to the plot.
@heath_emotional_2001 showed an effect of disgust increasing their participants' willingness to pass on pieces of information.
@mesoudi_bias_2006 elicited an effect of social information, in which stories about human interactions are better transmitted than individual human stories, or stories involving physical nonhuman elements alone.
The extensive reviews provided by @mesoudi_multiple_2008 and @whiten_cultural_2016 give a broader idea of the effects studied and methods used in the literature.

A more recent stream of research includes more explicit work on the individual steps and details of transmission chains.
@eriksson_advantage_2012, for instance, showed that a setup with two parallel chains that cross-fertilise each other will improve transmission rates:
at each generation, the two participants of the two parallel chains receive two inputs, one from each chain at the previous generation, leading to a decrease in information loss compared to a single chain where participants read twice the same content (of the previous generation).
@acerbi_role_2016 further modelled such error-correcting redundancy, simulating toy scenarios that could favour its evolution at given cost-reward constraints.
@eriksson_corpses_2014 continued this detailing endeavour by further breaking down real world transmission into choose-to-receive, encode-and-retrieve, and choose-to-transmit phases;
focusing on emotional selection as studied by @heath_emotional_2001, they showed that any of those phases can be the target of selection pressure, further noticing that such pressures could be contradictory and could thus considerably complicate the simple picture used up to then.
@moussaid_amplification_2015, in studying the transmission of risk perception, used a much more free-form setup:
after the first participant of a chain had read initial documents, later participants were left to talk freely in successive dyads, leaving open the interaction and underlying transmission of information.
A analogous change of setup was operated by @caldwell_studying_2008 and @caldwell_experimental_2008 who investigated the cumulative aspect of the evolution of building techniques in a series of experiments asking participants to construct spaghetti towers or paper planes (evaluated by their height or flight distance).
A crucial point in those setups, @sterelny_cultural_2017 [n. 12] notes, is that participants could observe the preceding generation during their experimenting and building, thus providing rich context to the learning phase of transmission.
Perhaps most interesting, @mcgraw_cultures_2014, in studying the evolution (though not the transmission) of Lego car constructions made by pairs of participants, integrate the critiques discussed in @sec:intro-review-criticisms:
the authors take the complete joint interaction to be their ultimate object of study, proposing to use the constructions resulting from interacting dyads as a trace of the processes that took place in the interaction.
By looking at the characteristics of the cars built by participants, the authors claim their study "presents methods for discerning, and quantifying, schema-like intersubjective understandings in material form" [@mcgraw_cultures_2014, p. 4].
This short review shows there is much room for exploration, on one side, of the methodological choices in transmission chain experiments (some of which will turn out to be more important than others in the trends observed), and on the other, of the theoretical background that sustain a given study, and correspondingly of the debates that such experiments can bring insight to.

### Criticisms and alternatives {#sec:intro-review-criticisms}
