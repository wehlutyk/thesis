### 20th Century

Social science has concerned itself with the stability, temporal evolution, and spatial variations and regularities of cultures since the very start of its discipline.
The question of how culture and psychology are part of one another, and how best to describe that intricacy, has correspondingly generated much debate throughout the 20th century.
Of the countless insights that anthropology and sociology has produced on that subject, I present the small sample which has influenced the guiding questions of this thesis.

Ã‰mile Durkheim already, in his seminal study [-@durkheim_suicide:_2012], was looking at the regularities of suicide rates over the years, and the correlation of those rates with a partition of society into religion-related groups.
The continuity of suicide over time, and the links between suicide rate and social group, he argued, suggest we should study suicide as a *social fact*:
a phenomenon which, in spite of manifesting itself individually, has emerging properties in large groups, with a causal life at the level of other emergent social phenomena.
In particular, this emergence has effects on individual psychology (in noting this, Durkheim was aiming to establish the autonomy of sociology as a science).
Investigating the mechanisms of such an effect, the ties it weaves with psychology, and the role it plays in shaping the stability and evolution of cultures, became a central question for social science since then.

Later, @mauss_les_1936 studied the ways in which people of different communities, in the world and throughout history, use their bodies in different ways:
he noticed and began documenting the resting postures, the attitudes, the ways of walking, of swimming, or of sleeping, that different societies transmit to their offspring and evolve through time.
Thus his endeavour focused precisely on describing culture as an embodied and physical property of life, incorporated through the everyday practices of a community, and that children grow into by imitation, teaching, or other kinds of learning.
In this sense, he argued, there is no normal way of walking, there are only *ways* of walking:
by living with different bodily practices, different communities quite simply develop different bodies.
Indeed most of these *techniques of the body* documented by Mauss have noticeable effects on the physiology of people that grow into them:
they will make one able to crouch for long periods of time or sleep while standing or horse-riding, and will also, Mauss argued for instance, change the shape of an adult body by influencing the way bones develop.
While such practices are undeniably linked to the history of communities, and in that sense are social, Mauss also he asked what part psychology played in their development, and what influence they have in turn on psychology.
He considered them complete *physio-psycho-sociological* phenomena.
