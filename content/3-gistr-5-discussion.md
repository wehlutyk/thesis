The need for embedding

Any quantitative study relies on abstracting out details of particular cases by reducing (most often averaging) values in each dimension to a few indicators.
Being able to render a precise view of the studied phenomenon then depends on being able to determine which are the right dimensions to describe it, and having access to them [@becker_epistemology_1996].

Embedding experiments in the everyday life of subjects gives access to dimensions that can be otherwise unavailable:
through the use of smartphones, an experiment designer can trigger interactions with subjects (for instance asking questions) at any moment of the day, or have measures running while subjects are offline (using the ever-increasing number of sensors present on the devices), both of which are impossible with digital traces.
Above all, embedding an experiment means getting greater access to context, which opens the possibility of understanding phenomena the way they are meant in the lives of subjects, and not only in the way they are construed by the experiment designer.

*Daydreaming* is an example experiment developed as a smartphone application with Vincent Adam, Mikaël Bastian, Jérôme Sackur, and Gislain Delaire, that took advantage of this embedding.
The experiment, focused on our awareness of daily mind-wandering, would probe subjects during a month at random moments of the day to ask them if they were mind-wandering (and, if so, what were the qualities of their thoughts).

While our team spent over a year developing the application, it allowed asking questions related to ecological situations which cannot exist in laboratory or passive collection studies.
\autoref{f:dd-question} shows a sample question asked to the subjects, and \autoref{f:dd-results} shows an example of the results produced at the end of the experiment (this particular screen shows the results for one subject; seeing their own results was part of the reward for subjects participating in the study).

* *Embedding*:
as explained above, smartphone-based experiments allow for real-life embedding:
the experiment designer can choose when and how interactions with the experiment and between subjects take place, and measure any number of variables the device gives them access to (geolocation, time, phone agitation through its accelerometers, general noise level, etc.), virtually at any moment.
