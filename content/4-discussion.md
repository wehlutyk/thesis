## Introduction


## Empirical epidemiology of linguistic representations


### Synthesis of results
path taken

- initial question: empirical attractors in language
- approaches taken: MT, Gistr
- trade-offs in the process: simplification, engineering, no context
- results: consistent with convergence, detailed model providing first bridge between lower and higher levels


### Challenges
what limits progress, from examples blending into theory

- no grip on meaning
- examples of meaning change in Gistr
- example on twitter
- under-specified convergence problem
- divides into: content problem, context problem, dynamics problem


## No theory of content
The problems of meaning

- no clear definition of meaning (beyond word meaning)
- varies with history, situation, attention
- many levels
- obviously comes from continuous interactions, but bears value, and the value can also be recognised and repeated


### Contenders
expose the theoretical problem, and contenders: RT/Millikan and enactivism

- inside the representational approach, the problem is 1) the content of representations (Millikan), 2) how communication infers the content (RT)
- inside enactivism, you start with some content, but you need a way to arrive to structure communication and fleshing out the details


### Outside the linguistic domain
show it's not limited to linguistics (ingold critique)

- three layers
- three degrees of critique, relating to NCT/DST


## Baby and bathwater: From theory to empirical study
ways to move forward

- further determine if they compete for the exact same space
- it's a productive contradiction to build from (without falling into scholasticism), which can inspire experiments
