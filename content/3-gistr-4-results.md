## Results {#sec:gistr-results}

### Descriptive observations

We begin the analysis of our three data sets by examining aggregate statistics and their evolution as a function of depth in the trees.
Here and in what follows, the analyses are made on the data cleaned of spam, and chains truncated at their target depth:
the data from Experiment 1 stops at depth 8, Experiment 2 at depth 7, and Experiment 3 at depth 10.
All plots are aligned to the some depth axis to facilitate comparisons.
In this section, we eliminate stop words from the utterances and focus on the transformation of content words.
For a given utterance $u$, the list of its content words is noted $c(u)$, and the number of content words is therefore $|c(u)|_w$, where $|\cdot|_w$ counts the number of words of a string or list of words.


#### Utterance length

A well-known effect in transmission chains with linguistic content is the reduction in length.
@Fig:gistr-lengths shows a scatter plot of the number of content words of an utterance $|c(u)|_w$ versus depth in a tree.
The insets show the plots restricted to trees whose root utterance has less than 15 content words (thus most utterance in those trees also have less than 15 content words).
As noted above, the reduction in length varied considerably according to the type of source utterance.

![Reduction in utterance content length across the three experiments.
The insets show the data for root utterances with less than 15 content words, with linear regression slope and correlation coefficient.
All slopes are non-zero with $p < .001$.
