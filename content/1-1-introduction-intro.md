# Introduction

Have you ever been hit by the sudden memory of a sentence you read somewhere, maybe in an article a few days back, without being able to locate exactly when or where that was?
You might type what you remember of the sentence in an online search engine, but nothing comes out.
You recall the ideas that the sentence had triggered for you.
You change the wording a little, play around with the phrasing, trying to recreate the particular rhythm and sequence of words that had led you to ideas that are still so crisp and clear in your mind.
Still, the search engine doesn't find the source.
You might even tell a friend about this sentence, to see if it reminds her of something you could be missing.
Hours or days later, a chance encounter leads you to remember which article you read the sentence in.
You open the article, find the sentence and read it carefully, and while the idea you remembered is definitely there, it becomes clear that your own phrasing was somewhat different.
For instance, the middle part was missing in what you had typed in the search engine, and one or two words were changed.
No wonder the search didn't succeed!

While looking for the source of this sentence, however, you might have used half a dozen other formulations of the idea you had in mind.
The present thesis is interested in these reformulations, for which three main questions can be asked:
What do reformulations have in common with the original, and in what ways are they changed?
What are the factors that influence those changes, and by what mechanisms do they act?
How would such changes accumulate if you were to tell your own phrasing to someone else, to be later recalled?
At play in this example is a routine set of processes of everyday life:
we interpret, memorise and transform ideas that arise in the course of our interactions;
sometimes, ideas of our own are also passed on to someone else with other transformations along the way.
The aim of this thesis is to gain a little insight into the effects and the set of processes at play in the successive transformation of short utterances as they are passed on between people.
Our method is empirical and exploratory:
we study these transformations through experiments that leave open the set of possible changes, and we do so with methods that combine previously isolated approaches to the question, so as to work around the limitations of each.

The more general goal of this thesis is to contribute a detailed empirical study case to Cultural Attraction Theory (also known as the theory of Epidemiology of Representations), a broad framework to understand the way ideas, practices, habits and techniques evolve in a community.
Since its initial introduction by @sperber_explaining_1996, this proposal has grown into one of the two main cognitively-inspired approaches to understanding the way a community's culture evolves over time due to mechanisms at the inter-individual level [the other approach being Standard Cultural Evolution, @cavalli-sforza_cultural_1981; @boyd_culture_1985].
These approaches, now "a booming cottage industry on the borders of evolutionary biology, archaeology, and biological anthropology" [@sterelny_cultural_2017], also propose a way of combining works from anthropology, cognitive science and evolutionary biology, disciplines that have remained isolated from one another for too long.

The cultural attraction proposal we focus on is explicitly not a reduction of one of these fields to the other.
Nor does it claim to be a grand theory unifying all the disciplines studying life under one umbrella.
Instead, Cultural Attraction Theory (henceforth CAT) creates bridges between cognitive science and anthropology so that the two can eventually work together in a common formulation of their questions.
To do so it proposes a general ontology where culture is thought of as a collection of representations:
representations can be either public, for instance a picture, a public speech, or this thesis, or they can be mental, when someone interprets a public representation that they are perceiving.
The ideas I am presenting in this thesis, for instance, form mental representations in my mind.
As I write them down, they appear to you as a public representation.
If my writing is clear and accurate enough, the mental representations that you will form while reading this thesis should be relatively close to the representations I have [@sperber_explaining_1996, p. 1].
In all likelihood, however, substantial change will have appeared in the process, just as in our example above.
CAT suggests that the culture of a society can be modelled as a large dynamical system of representations being constantly interpreted into mental versions, and produced as new and transformed public representations.
A central question then appears:
given the significant changes that representations undergo each time they are interpreted and produced anew, how is it that culture can be so stable over time?
The cultural attraction approach answers this question by proposing that, due to the interaction of the cognitive processes and contextual factors at play when representations are transformed, the dynamical system that models a society should have attractors.
In other words, it suggests that there are regions of representation space, more or less contingent on the state of culture at a point in time, towards which representations tend to come closer when they are transformed;
these are called *cultural attractors*, and are CAT's main concept for explaining the stability of culture over time.

The hypothesis of cultural attractors is interesting in two respects.
On one side, it provides intelligibility into culture and its processes of change.
On the other side, it incorporates a central claim of the theory, namely that cognitive processes play an important role in the way culture evolves over time.
Empirically validating the existence of such attractors has thus become a major goal for the theory, but doing so has proven challenging.
Indeed, it is not easy to collect quantitative data on the evolution of representations.
Up to now, empirical approaches to the question have fallen into three broad categories, each of which has some limitations.
The first is to simulate the evolution of representations in the laboratory, using a setup known as a *transmission chain*.
This approach allows for a detailed analysis of the transformations, but is often forced to use particularly simple (and thus non-ecological) representations in order to make the analysis tractable.
The second approach is to compile historical and anthropological works on a given subject to reconstitute the evolution of a type of representation as documented.
This approach has also been successful in a number of cases, but has difficulties teasing apart the possible explanations for the evolutionary trajectories it observes.
The third approach is to study the evolution of representations in online social networks;
up to now, however, works in this area have mostly overlooked the cognitive mechanisms at work in the processes of transformation.

Our practical goal in this thesis, then, is to introduce new empirical methods which combine the strengths of existing approaches, and can contribute to the validation of cultural attractors.
Our focus on linguistic utterances comes from two reasons.
First, linguistic traces of online interactions are readily available and easy to collect, such that it is possible to assemble data sets of useful size and quality for the study of this case.
Second, aside from providing an extremely versatile type of representation that makes the question of transformations interesting in itself, language is also at the core of several criticisms of CAT.
Linguistic utterances are therefore a good use case to contribute to the debate surrounding CAT.
In what follows we will present two novel exploratory methods for the evolution of linguistic utterances, in which the detailed transformations can be observed, and the relevance of attractors in explaining the changes can be assessed.
The first method is an *in vivo* approach, which combines data mining techniques with psycholinguistics in order to analyse the transformations of representations observed in online interactions.
The approach thus relies on ecological data, but must face the high complexity of uncontrolled interactions between people in their everyday life.
It must also find ways to deal with any missing data that was not collected as part of the digital traces.
The second method is an *in vitro* technique:
it extends the current transmission chain approaches by creating a middle ground between the constraints of existing techniques, and manages to gather large sets of high-quality data with complex linguistic utterances, at an overall cost comparable to that of traditional laboratory transmission chains.
Since it is a laboratory approach at the core, one can control the complexity of the utterances introduced and adapt them to the analysis planned.
The downside is that participants in the experiment must be given a task to fulfil, which makes the experimental setting much less ecological than for *in vivo* approaches.

Both these approaches allow us to observe significant and detailed biases in the way utterances are transformed, with overall trends that are consistent with the existence of attractors at the level of lexical word variables.
Aside from the raw results that we uncover about the transformation of utterances, we contend that these experiments are useful in two other ways.
First, they allow for a more precise formulation of the questions asked by CAT.
The existence of cultural attractors in linguistic representations becomes a concrete question that can be evaluated using quantitative measures.
Obstacles to the emergence of attraction, and the extent to which the cultural attraction picture describes the empirical evolution of utterances, can also be assessed.
Second, the experimental use of cultural attraction principles renders obvious the strengths and limitations of the approach for the case of linguistic utterances, and highlights new questions that should be explored by further research.
In particular, we shall see that the exact definition, and thus the existence, of a cultural attractor strongly depends on the dimension at which we describe linguistic utterances, a question that cannot be decided at the principled level.
We will also see that the meaning of utterances is a crucial factor in the evolution of short utterances, and that an account of how meaning is understood in context must be included in the theory to make further progress in the linguistic case.

The present chapter reviews the relevant literature for current approaches to cultural evolution.
We begin by presenting the core questions of cultural evolution, the details of the theories that study it, and the empirical work that has been done in the area.
We then present a number of adjacent works that discuss the way cultural evolutionary approaches link biology, cognition and culture in a common framework.
Finally, we identify a number of outstanding questions left open by the literature, and further justify our choice of focus on cultural attractors.

@Sec:brainscopypaste presents our development of the *in vivo* experimental approach:
relying on a large data set of digital traces, we study changes suffered by quotations when they are copied online from blog to blog, despite the implicit rule according to which such representations should be copied without change.
By coding words with a number of well-studied lexical variables, we show that the way individual words are replaced elicits several low-level biases consistent with known lexical effects in psycholinguistics, and with the existence of attractors at the level of lexical word variables.

@Sec:gistr then presents the *in vitro* experimental approach:
we construct an online transmission chain platform which, through careful adjustment of experimental parameters and of the affordances provided by the interface, lets us collect large data sets of high-quality transmission chains, using sufficiently complex utterances to broadly sample the possible transformations.
This allows us to provide a much more general analysis of transformations.
By applying and extending a sequence alignment technique which originates in bioinformatics, we reliably decompose utterance transformations into small chunks of operations that are combined to create larger changes, thus proposing a first descriptive model of the transformation of utterances.
We describe the detailed behaviour of individual operations, and show that the overall evolution of utterances is compatible with the existence of an attractor at the lexical level.
At higher levels, however, we do not observe clear attraction patterns.

Finally, @sec:discussion discusses the importance of utterance meaning in the transformation process.
We first present a number of examples from the previous chapter where utterance meaning plays a significant role in transformations, and show that analysing such effects requires a full account of meaning in relation to interpretive context.
We then discuss two prominent approaches that could be used to face this problem:
Relevance Theory, and the Enactive approach to language.
We show how both approaches could be applied in the cultural attraction framework, and finally suggest a number of empirical possibilities that could be explored to make progress on these questions.
