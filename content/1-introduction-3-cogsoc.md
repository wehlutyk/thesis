- a second, related debate is how to integrate theories of cultural evolution with cognition and biology itself
- Ingold intro (who shares the fact that anthropology has not concerned itself with psychology recently, for various reasons). (For him there is no cognition that is not cultural, the same way there is no movement that is not cultural for Mauss, and the same way there is no culture that is not cognitively-determined or influenced.)

### In social science {#sec:intro-review-social}

Social science has concerned itself with the stability, temporal evolution, and spatial variations and regularities of cultures since the start of its discipline.


Contemporaries of Durkheim, as well as later researchers, made this matter one of their central preoccupations.

But as those works also acknowledged, such a question raises issues in need of prior clarification:
what is the exact status of culture in relation to psychology, or even biology, and how separable are they?
Correspondingly, the question of how culture and psychology are part of one another and, if at all separable, how are the two related, or how best to describe the intermingling of these possible levels, has generated much debate throughout the 20th century.


The question of the incorporation of culture, and behind it the inseparability of culture, physiology, and psychology, has remained central in social science.
Works closer to us have contributed to the matter:
for @bourdieu_sens_1980, societal norms are also incorporated in perception, and shape our everyday unreflective interpretation of events, our way of navigating life (our *sens pratique*).
According to him, norms become embedded in the fullest sense, through life, into our low-level perception and exploration of the environment.
Together, incorporated norms form what he calls a person's *habitus*, a concept he puts at the centre of his theory of social reproduction, building on the idea that members of a society grow into a *habitus* leading them to perceive events in ways that reinforce existing power structures.

Social scientists often criticise Bourdieu's approach for not providing a satisfactory account of individual agency, as in this view it still seems opposed to structure acting as a constraint on action.
Another prominent approach, the *Theory of Structuration* developed by @giddens_constitution_1984, offers a more balanced way out of the tension between agency and structure (or norms), and in doing so reflects yet a different view of the relation between psychology and culture.
Acknowledging that approaches that conceive of structure as an external constraint on individual agency cannot resolve that opposition, Giddens (closer to the notion used in structuralist works) sees structure itself as a set of properties of social systems that bear an inherent duality, and cannot be meaningfully isolated from agency:
on one side, action arises by using existing structured resources, and its reliance on structure, or referring to it, is what makes it action and not noise;
on the other side, the production of action is a new reinforcement of the structure on which it relies.
This notion of structure is akin to Saussure's notion of linguistic structure, which in turn inspired the structuralist tradition in social science:
on one side, Giddens recalls, in producing an utterance we rely on incorporated syntactic rules;
on the other side, the production of a meaningful utterance contributes to maintaining language as a structured totality.

<!--

To someone coming from mathematics, such a discussion can be seen as stating the obvious: in a network, the parts' identities are defined by their position respective to the rest of the network, and the totality is made of the identities of the parts.
So necessarily any definition separating parts and totality will be recursive.
But the discussion does bear on the distinction between culture and psychology, which exists in academic disciplines.

Giddens, on the structure and agency debate
After the functionalists and the structuralists (orthodoxy that collapsed), and after the critics from hermeneutics that revive the Verstehen/Erklären debate
Double Hermeneutics and Teoría social informada hermenéuticamente
Theory of structuration: theory of the subject, without falling into subjectivism. Both subject (human agent) and object (society, institutions) are made in and of recurrent practices.
Describes a continuous process of action-monitoring, with unconscious components, and a conscience pratique, with a simplistic view of the cognitive, but there nonetheless.
Structure is what permits something to be emitted, and what results from the emission (e.g. in language.), which is the way to escape a dualism in explaining the relation of part to totality.

\add{steiner-autonomy-2009, who connects Giddens (and others) with the questions of social cognition}

Anthropology and sociology have produced considerable amounts of work concerned with the nature of culture in relation to psychology, the most prominent parts of which are reviewed by @risjord_models_2012.
The sample I exposed here represents the approaches which have most influenced the initial questions of the present thesis.
Common behind the works of Mauss, Bourdieu, Giddens, and authors contemporary to each of them, lies a certain interest in eliminating biology-culture, nature-nurture, or substance-form dualisms which we routinely rely on in our conception of life.
This concern has remained central in contemporary social anthropology, and is worth keeping in mind when studying the cultural evolution approach that I will focus on in what follows.

While current writings often argue that such a separation is not "sharp" [@acerbi_cultural_2016 p. 2; relying on @morin_how_2016], the dualism it comes from permeates most of our theories about non-human animals, human beings, and life in general.
This thesis is no exception, as I am myself an apprentice of the traditions I present and discuss here.
However I see no reason to believe it is the best conceptual dicing one could achieve, and am (for now) agnostic about whether or not it should be maintained;
whenever such distinctions appear in what follows, for instance between cultural and biological evolution, I will thus be referring to the conception of the works discussed, and will attempt to clarify when otherwise.
I will come back to the consequences of this dualism in @sec:intro-review-criticisms, and will propose a more detailed discussion in @sec:discussion.

*These two parapraphs come from the removed discussion of Ingold, but can introduce the chat about NCT/EES/DST/Evo-devo. Simplify them.*

Ingold argues that Cultural Attraction Theory, as well as other approaches inpired by Darwin, relies on a description of life in three broad layers:
the biological layer, which serves as the substrate for the second layer, cognitive, which itself serves as the substrate for the third layer, cultural.
Each layer identifies a conceptual domain taken to be fundamentally different from the other two.
The biological level is described by the modern synthesis of evolutionary theory, centred on genetic change, and studies the *body*.
The cognitive level is described by cognitive science using the computational metaphor, which allows for the study of *mind* without necessarily worrying about its biological manifestation.
In turn, the cultural level is described by (for instance) Cultural Attraction Theory, which studies *culture* as a distribution of representations circulating in society.
The biological and cognitive layers define constraints on the way representations evolve at the cultural level (in particular through cognitive biases), but knowledge about the cultural level is not crucial to study the essential, universal parts of the mind or the body.

Each layer thus corresponds to its own object of study, implemented by the lower layers but conceptually independent from them.
Ingold calls this assembly the *complementarity thesis*, referring to the way body, mind and culture are construed as separate and complementary parts of reality [@ingold_complementarity_1998].
The criticism he opposes to this approach can then be grouped into three essential points:
(1) Each layer of the complementarity thesis is rooted in a problematic dualism that separates form and substance.
(2) Without such dualisms, it is not possible to conceptually distinguish the three layers:
there concrete manifestations are inextricable from one another, as they appear interlocked in a single object of study:
the organism.
If it is necessary to conceptually dice reality into parts or layers, it is not clear that the separation between biology, cognition and culture is the best way of doing so.
(3) The notion of organism is itself problematic.

- the question about the genetic/non-genetic divide is precisely what is discussed by NCT/EES/DST/Evo-devo, and is also well discussed by @griffiths_genetics_2013 (read intro); we take it as an open question about how to cluster the inheritance lifecycles
- debates on the cognitive side of things are beyond the scope of this intro/review, though chapter 4 will touch on them


### Developments {#sec:intro-review-developments}

The exact nature of evolution is subject to debate in biology and philosophy of biology, and some of the recent developments have made their way into the core of cultural evolution theory.
In a parallel movement, the nature of cognition is itself debated inside philosophy of cognitive science.
The aim of the next two sections is to briefly discuss the relevant parts of those debates for the cultural evolution approach, delineating first the elements that could be---or are already partly---integrated into mainstream CAT, and second the critiques which, at least in current writings, seem to call for a partial rethink of the paradigm.
The questions here are more theoretical than above, as they explore both the way different disciplines studying life are best meshed together, and what core components should be at the root of such a convergence.
This is not to say the debates in biology and cognitive science concern theory alone, as each debated position is well supported by empirical work;
rather, up to now those works have not translated to actionable contradictory predictions in the study of cultural evolution proper.
Nonetheless, I will argue in @sec:discussion that these debates provide crucial context to understand a particular practical challenge in the empirical study of CAT, namely the definition of the meaning of representations and its impact on the dimensions of attraction.
I begin with developments then, that is the elements that seem possible to integrate into CAT.
These also lay some of the groundwork for the subsequent criticisms, which I believe challenge CAT closer to its foundations.


#### Niche construction theory

A central question in the study of evolution is the definition of what counts as heritable material, for which two broad views are competing.
The debate, agreements and disagreements between both views are well documented, and I base the following discussion on the recent reviews provided by @laland_does_2014 and @scott-phillips_niche_2014.
The standard account of biological evolution, or Standard Evolutionary Theory (SET) as termed by @scott-phillips_niche_2014, defines evolution as "change in the frequency of DNA sequences (i.e., genes and associated regulatory regions) in a population, from one generation to the next" [@scott-phillips_niche_2014 p. 1232; referring to @futuyma_evolution_2005].
Such change occurs through what is known as an evolutionary process:

> "Evolutionary processes are generally thought of as processes by which these changes occur. Four such processes are widely recognized: natural selection (in the broad sense, to include sexual selection), genetic drift, mutation, and migration [@fisher_genetical_1930; @haldane_causes_1932]. The latter two generate variation; the first two sort it."
> [@scott-phillips_niche_2014, p. 1232]

In this view, DNA sequences constitute the principle heritable material transmitted from parent to offspring across generations, and their distribution and change should be the main focus of evolutionary theory.
Furthermore:

> "There are many factors that can cause these four evolutionary processes to occur, and for the skeptics [of Niche Construction Theory], niche construction is one such factor."
> [@scott-phillips_niche_2014, p. 1233]

Niche construction is the process by which organisms engineer their own and other organisms' environment in ways that are often beneficial to them.
A classic example of such niches are the dams built by beavers along the rivers they inhabit;
a beaver-built dam creates a local lake, and its presence actively changes the environment in which future generations of beavers---as well as neighbouring organisms---develop.
The constructed niche is inherited across generations such that it can have a lasting impact on the selection pressures under which later generations evolve.
SET recognises this phenomenon and defenders of the classical account are among those who actively study it [@laland_does_2014].
Niche Construction Theory [NCT, @odling-smee_niche_2003], however, contends that increasing amounts of evidence are unsatisfactorily accounted for by SET (though not in contradiction with it), and proposes "a broadened concept of inheritance, including 'ecological inheritance,' the modified environmental states that niche-constructing organisms bequeath to their descendants" [@scott-phillips_niche_2014, p. 1233].
Those constructed environmental states bias the natural selection of later generations (so-called "selective niche"), and also affect the social and ecological environment in which offspring develop (so-called "ontogenetic niche"), both being processes that can lead to evolutionary feedback loops.
The evolution of dairying, as analysed by @obrien_genes_2012, is claimed as a paradigmatic case that is well accounted for by NCT.

\add{gilbert-eco-evo-devo:-2015 if clearly aligned}

NCT is part of a broader movement in evolutionary biology that seeks to integrate a strong view of such feedback dynamics into evolutionary theory, by combining evolutionary developmental biology ("Evo-Devo") with the evolution of the environment in which development take place.
These works argue for an Extended Evolutionary Synthesis [EES, also presented as Eco-Evo-Devo by @gilbert_eco-evo-devo:_2015], conceiving of evolution as the co-evolution of organism and environment, a system that inherits genetic material, but also constructed selective and ontogenetic niches.
The crux of the disagreement with SET lies in the importance of the dynamics that this feedback generates:
SET considers it more parsimonious to define evolution as change in frequency of DNA sequences, and thus frames niche construction and other ecological inheritance processes as a cause for changes in DNA.
Conversely, EES considers it more *fruitful* to define evolution as change in the whole organism-environment system, for which niche construction is a core evolutionary process, like genetic mutation or natural selection.
According to @scott-phillips_niche_2014, the current evidence does not tease the two perspectives apart unequivocally:
all known phenomena can still be explained by both approaches with varying degrees of shoehorning, and predictions from each theory can be rephrased into the other one (although such inseparability might not last).
However, proponents of EES argue that the study of ecological processes in evolution, while present in SET, has become systematic only thanks to the change of focus brought by the development of NCT.

The Extended Evolutionary Synthesis offers a natural framework for the study of all aspects of evolution, be they cultural or biological, and indeed the gene-culture co-evolution framework fits well with this synthesis.
The communities developing those approaches overlap partially (Marcus Feldman, notably, is a core contributor to both research streams), and @sterelny_cultural_2017 argues that NCT is a core---if sometimes implicit---component of both Californian and Parisian cultural evolution.
Indeed, EES is capable of integrating a non-opinionated notion of culture as part of the organism-environment system under study, and the task at hand then joins up with that of dual inheritance theory, presented above:
identifying the co-evolution dynamics of genetic and environmental inheritance channels.
On this view, then, culture is accounted for by a blend of ecological and cognitive-epistemic niche construction processes.


#### "4E" cognitive science: the extended mind

\todo{use chemero-after-2008 for this summary}

In a strikingly parallel movement in cognitive science and philosophy of mind, the nature of cognition and its units of analysis have been debated along two broad dimensions [see @chemero_after_2008 for a detailed review of questions and possible answers].
\(1) The boundaries of cognition:
are cognitive processes brain-bound, do they extend to the body, or do they include the environment or the surrounding (cognitive) organisms, and if so in what sense [@clark_extended_1998; @menary_extended_2010].
\(2) The role of time-dependent dynamics, and the corresponding construal of the nature of cognition:
are cognitive systems best described as digital computers processing information in the form of representations (i.e. symbol processing systems), where time can often be reduced to an ordering of events, or are they best described as dynamical systems where time is important to define rates of change, flows, or dynamic couplings [@van_gelder_dynamical_1998; @beer_information_2015].
In treating these questions, the extended, embedded, embodied, and enactive approaches to cognitive science (the so-called "4E") have argued to various degrees that cognition is not only (or not at all) an information-processing operation that can take place in the void, but also (or exclusively) a situated activity supported by (or a dynamic coupling with) its environment.
The extended mind theory, among the less radical 4E approaches, is quite compatible with EES and thus with both Californian and Parisian cultural evolution.
Indeed @sterelny_minds:_2010 [-@sterelny_evolved_2012], building on NCT, has argued that the extended mind approach is a special case of epistemic niche construction.
He suggests that the environments human beings grow in are the result of cumulative cognitive niche construction processes, that engineer the material and social environment of humans to support the growth of everyday cognitive capacities, thus scaffolding cognition during development and life.


### Criticisms {#sec:intro-review-criticisms}


#### Developmental systems theory

A related and somewhat complementary extension to the standard evolutionary account has developed in parallel to NCT, with a more radical notion of extended inheritance:
Developmental Systems Theory [DST, @oyama_ontogeny_2000; @oyama_cycles_2001].
Kim Sterelny characterises it, on one side, with three critical theses:

> "(1) We cannot simply assume that the organism/environment boundary is of theoretical significance for developmental and evolutionary biology ... (2) It may be legitimate to foreground genetic structure and genetic change for specific explanatory or predictive purposes. But in general, the genes an organism carries are just one set of developmental resources among many. Genes and gene changes are important both to development and to evolution, but they are not of primary or privileged importance. (3) Developmental systems theorists are skeptical about the project of explaining intergenerational similarity by appealing to the transmission of phenotype-making information across generations."
> [@sterelny_niche_2001, p. 335]

Crucially, DST claims that overlooked evidence in development indicates that there is a "causal parity" between genes and non-genetic development factors, such that evolutionary theories should not give greater (or smaller) importance to the former over the latter.
This in turn sustains the third thesis:
views of the genome as a bearer of biological information should be qualified in light of the complex interactions between developmental processes in which genes participate [for further detail, see @griffiths_genetics_2013, who extensively review the ways in which genes can be, or historically have been, considered to bear information].
Now the other side of Sterelny's characterisation of DST is its positive story:

> "The positive program of developmental systems theory is that the fundamental unit of evolution is the life cycle. In turn, the life cycle is the set of developmental resources that are packaged together and interact in such a way that the cycle is reconstructed. The most obvious life cycle is that of the organism plus its immediate environment, but developmental systems theorists are open to the idea that cycles will exist at both finer and coarser grains."
> [@sterelny_niche_2001, p. 335]

A driving goal in DST is to recontextualise, explain, and if possible do without the conceptual divide between matter and form, that is between specification and realisation, which underlies most discussions of nature-nurture [@oyama_ontogeny_2000].
This implies putting an endogenous account of the concept of information at the centre of its theory, by focusing on the way such information is generated through the dynamics of a system as it develops and as its resources interact.

In many aspects, NCT-EES and DST complement each other [see @griffiths_discussion:_2005 on the complementarity of DST and Evo-Devo in particular].
However for the current purposes I suggest we locate both approaches with respect to the two following questions:

- How far should models and theories of evolution integrate the detailed processes of development and environmental interaction to provide an accurate picture of evolution?
  This question is not about finding the right level of descriptive complexity, but about finding the relative importance of each level of complexity.
  In other words, it asks what is the shape of the cost function representing the trade-off between parsimony and explanatory power (rather than where on that function should a theory operate).
  The classical account of evolution suggests development can be usefully abstracted away, such that analysing gene flow with the four recognised processes (natural selection, genetic drift, mutation, and migration) can account for all important evolutionary dynamics.
  NCT claims that organism-environment interactions can generate dynamics that do not fit into the standard account but have long term effects nonetheless, warranting an extension of the evolutionary processes considered.
  DST further claims that evolution's unit of analysis should be the full life cycle of a developmental system (organism or other), which makes it more difficult to abstract out absolute information items but guarantees an accurate view of the causal parity of developmental resources, such that developmental processes are not obviated.
- What notion of information should evolutionary theory rely on?
  Classical evolutionary theory and NCT rely on the idea that DNA bears the biological information that is used throughout development, in an interaction with the environment.
  Conversely, DST refuses to conceptually separate inherited from acquired traits, a separation it sees as unnecessary for a populational approach:
  instead it adopts a relational notion of information as the co-product of development, "not by special creation from nothingness, but always from the conditional transformation of prior structure---that is, by ontogenetic processes" [@oyama_ontogeny_2000, p. 4].

Notably, the stances adopted by DST put it at odds with a dual-channel account of cultural evolution.
While the developmental systems approach is compatible with population thinking, and thus with darwinian approaches in general [@griffiths_discussion:_2005], it sees no theoretical reason to conceptually isolate different genetic and cultural channels of inheritance.
Aside from genetic material and ecological niches, developmental systems also inherit epigenetic material, behavioural patterns and communication systems [@jablonka_systems_2001] and more generally the full matrix of resources involved in the development of the system at its next life cycle.
It might be useful for practical or descriptive reasons to focus more on some resources than on others, as is done for instance in the study of phylogeny, but doing so does not change the developmental interactions and causal parity of those resources with the rest of the set.
A similar point will be made, below, about representations for the study of cognition.


#### Convergence

The notion of developmental system, and the importance it gives to the ontogenetic niche in which organisms grow, is convergent with 4E cognitive science and Sterelny's scaffolded mind approach.
Aside from providing a natural account of culture similar to that of EES, DST also integrates the role of the ontogenetic niche in development all the way up to the cognitive level [@stotz_human_2010].
@wimsatt_reproducing_2007 have argued that an appropriate focus on scaffolding and development could shed light on the mechanisms of inheritance across generations, a necessary step in an account of cultural evolution.
In agreement with DST, however, the authors feel that fixed- or dual-channel accounts of inheritance based on a notion of information transferred to offspring^[
  The definition provided by @boyd_origin_2005, and adopted by @mesoudi_towards_2006, is along these lines.
  The authors define culture as "information capable of affecting individuals’ behavior that they acquire from other members of their species by teaching, imitation, and other forms of social transmission" [@boyd_origin_2005, p. 6].
]
obviate the role of development.
Conversely, grounding an account of constancy and change in developmental processes requires considering all the resources that a system inherits, and their interaction in development.

In spite of such differences, the literature indicates that many aspects of EES, DST, and 4E cognitive science seem possible to fruitfully integrate for the study of cultural evolution.
Indeed, DST is compatible with the population approach necessary for a darwinist analysis of culture [@griffiths_discussion:_2005; @lewens_cultural_2012, p. 477], which is one of the core elements on which both the Parisian and the Californian cultural evolution streams are built.
@lewens_cultural_2012 [p. 474] also remarks on the encouraging fact that Russell Gray is both one of the main authors of DST, and is now an outspoken proponent of cultural evolutionary theory.
A final case in point is the successful application of these ideas in theoretical and empirical proposals:
as noted above, @croft_evolutionary_2013 provides a compelling account of language evolution that integrates the main contentions of DST;
@mcgraw_cultures_2014 also merge an interactionist approach to mind with classical cultural evolutionary theory, relying on both research streams to analyse the products of the repeated interaction experiment they study.

The shift in focus, from intrinsic capabilities of information-processing systems to the dynamical properties of the coupling of organisms with their environment, is also aligned with parts of the criticisms addressed by anthropologists to the initial versions of Californian and Parisian cultural evolution [@fuentes_evolution_2006; -@fuentes_new_2009; @ingold_complementarity_1998; -@ingold_transmission_2001].


#### "4E" revisited: the enactive approach

\todo{use chemero-after-2008 for this summary}

A second avatar of the debate on the nature of information in evolution presents itself with the nature of representations in cognitive science.
There are two levels to this question.
First, if cognitive systems are construed as information- or representation-processing systems, the naturalisation of the content of such representations is a non-trivial matter;
indeed it has attracted much attention in philosophy of mind.
Second, it is not clear that information processing, and thus an account centrally based on representations, is the best description of the nature of cognition itself (as noted above, this is one of the driving questions in the debate around 4E cognitive science).
More radical streams of the 4E movement contend that a notion of representation is unnecessary to account for the vast majority---if not all---of human cognition, and are developing alternative proposals (the capacity of cognitive systems to represent, if maintained in the theory, may then be seen as a contingent property and not a constitutive part).
The enactive approach, in particular, proposes such an account of cognition.
As described by @varela_embodied_1991, @di_paolo_autopoiesis_2005, and @thompson_mind_2007, the enactive account builds on the notion of autopoiesis and ties cognition to living systems, considered as networks of processes that depend on each other for continued operation and continually produce and reproduce both the boundaries separating them from their environment and the conditions of their operation.
Given this definition, a living system dies, that is loses its identity, if its network of self-producing processes ceases from functioning, and as such every interaction with the environment bears intrinsic value in terms of its contribution to the maintenance of the system's identity.
This value is the basis for the enactive notion of meaning, which displaces the focus on information, or content, in representationalist accounts.
Since living systems use their environment to self-reproduce, they are continually coupled to it in order to maintain the organisation of their network of processes.
Cognition, then, is the dynamic regulation that the system operates on its coupling with the environment, and is an intrinsically meaning-making activity.

The enactive approach leads to a notion of meaning as a property emerging from the dynamics of interaction with the environment, and can be relevant at several levels of a system's organisation.
This notion, and the view of cognition as a *meaning-making* activity, are also central in enactive accounts of social cognition [@de_jaegher_participatory_2007] and of the basic processes underlying language [@cuffari_participatory_2015].
The rationale for the approach is quite similar to that of developmental systems theory:
talk of representations (or of biological information, in the case of DST) easily leads to what @thompson_mind_2007, building on @oyama_ontogeny_2000, calls an "informational dualism".
The conceptual separation between matter and content creates a gap, and reifies information in a way that makes it difficult to naturalise.

These works are not explicitly directed towards the study of cultural evolution, and are by no means the only proposals competing within the debate on representations.
Yet I will argue in [@sec:gistr;@sec:discussion] that CAT's reliance on mental representations as a unit of analysis renders this matter especially relevant, both theoretically and empirically, to the study of cultural evolution.
The enactive treatment, among the most radical of the positive accounts because of its non-representationalist commitment, can serve as a useful point of reference, at the far end of the spectrum, in assessing approaches to information and meaning in the context of cultural evolution.

\add{Somewhere: "The epidemiological approach renders manageable the methodological problem raised by the fact that our access to the content of representations is unavoidably interpretive. The solution to this methodological problem of ethnography is not to devise some special hermeneutics giving us access to representations belonging to a culture, yet uninstantiated in the individual heads or the physical environment of its members. The solution is merely to render more reliable our ordinary ability to understand what people like you, Opote or me say and think. This is so because, in an epidemiological explanation, the explanatory mechanisms are individual mental mechanisms and inter-individual mechanisms of communication; the representations to be taken into account are those which are constructed and transformed by these micro-mechanisms. In other words, the relevant representations are at the same concrete level as those that daily social intercourse causes us to interpret." (p. 53)
So it really isn't a reductionism, but a "bridging the gaps" between approaches.
"The kind of naturalism I have in mind aims at bridging gaps between the sciences. not at universal reduction. Some important generalizations are likely to be missed when causal relationships are not accounted for in terms of lower-level mechanisms. Other valuable generalizations would be lost if we paid attention to lower-level mechanisms only. If we want bridges, it is so as to be able to move both ways." (p. 98)
}

\add{Somewhere: "The psychological features pertinent to determining types of cultural things may well include features of their content. Of course, content features can be characterized only interpretively. To say that various representations share a content feature amounts to saying that they can all be interpreted, at a given level and from a given point of view, in the same way. Still, that property of common interpretability, with all its vagueness, may suffice, if not to describe, then at least to pick out, a class of phenomena all affected by some identical causal factors." (p. 54)}
