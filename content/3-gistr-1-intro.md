## Introduction {#sec:gistr-intro}

The previous chapter demonstrated that it is possible to observe cognitive biases in the way quotations are copied from blog to blog.
By grounding those biases in known effects in the recall of word lists, we also showed that the enquiry of cultural evolution for linguistic content can be related to lower-level cognitive mechanisms that help understand the way content is transformed in ecological situations.
However in the online corpus we considered only extremely simple transformations, namely individual word replacements, so as to make it possible to infer missing links between quotations, thus make the analysis possible.
While we observed a reliable bias in the way words are replaced, consistent with known psycholinguistic biases, our view of the overall transformations is extremely narrow:
not only is it restricted to word replacements, it is limited to the replacements that were the only change in an utterance (other than sentence cropping).
The analysis also remained at the low-level of lexical properties such as word frequency and age of acquisition, neither of which give much insight into the semantic changes that utterances can suffer.
Finally, constraints of the data did not let us identify chains of transformations, and we could not observe the evolution of quotations beyond the individual transformation step.

We now wish to remedy most of these points by studying the evolution of short utterances in a controlled experimental setting.
A controlled setting means having a less ecological situation, but also allows for the collection of all the available data for analysis.
Once again, our approach is exploratory, and we aim to reach a more complete understanding of the transformation process that is at work in the propagation of online quotations, but also more widely in the evolution of linguistic content as it is transmitted in society.
More precisely, our goal is to construct a descriptive model of the process that can bring insight into why utterances change the way they do, and how such observations can be connected to current knowledge in linguistics, on one side, and to the broader cultural evolution frameworks, on the other.
If we succeed in creating such a descriptive model, explaining the details of the process with lower-level cognitive mechanisms should then be easier.

The ideal setup to tackle this question would be a standard transmission chain where we observe the accumulated transformations of subjects on a set of utterances that we choose.
However, given our exploratory approach and the fact that we do not know in advance what the model will look like, it is important that we can run several such experiments in short cycles so as to adjust the task parameters and the sampling of utterances.
It is also important that the collected data be of similar size to the number of substitutions we extracted in the previous chapter, so that we will be able to compare and validate any overlapping results.
We thus chose to run a set of transmission chain experiments on an online platform developed for the purpose:
as we shall see, after an initial development phase this approach lets us collect large amounts of data in short periods of time, while maintaining a level of control similar to that of laboratory experiments.

We begin by discussing the works relevant to this endeavour, and in particular the bind in which current transmission chain experiments on linguistic content find themselves.
We then present the procedure followed to develop the online experimental platform, and the measures implemented to achieve a high level of quality in the data.
Next, we expose our analysis of the data sets collected, expose the descriptive model of transformations we construct from them, and highlight the main behaviours the model lets us observe.
Finally, we discuss the relevance of these results in the broader context of the study of cultural evolution.
