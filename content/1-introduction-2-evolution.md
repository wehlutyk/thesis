## Culture, stability and change

### The notion of culture: a question and a problem

#### Stability and change

Habits, rituals, languages and ways of thinking are strikingly diverse across different regions of the globe.
When spending time in a foreign country and getting to know people who live there, we are often surprised by how different their behaviour is from our own, be it in obvious touristy attractions or in minute and unsuspected details.
People salute each other and lead mundane interactions differently;
they wash and eat with different equipment, utensils, bodily movements, and at different rhythms and moments of the day.
If one understands the language, it is often clear that people in a foreign country also *think* differently:
ideas that we feel are deeply counter-intuitive are obvious to them and need not be said;
other things we might spontaneously say will outrage them;
misunderstandings are widespread.
The differences are such that we are easily tired, and after a while we become uncomfortable in daily interactions, without noticing exactly why.
One need not travel to distant countries to experience such changes:
being immersed in an unfamiliar social circle at home can be enough.
This set of artefacts, practices, bodily and thinking habits, which can be so varied from one community to another, is what we commonly call a culture.
Culture is a fuzzy notion of course, but an important one, since we use it to label the aspects of life that vary most, or that vary the fastest, across human and animal communities, and to set them aside from those that vary less or more slowly (for instance, the shape of the body).

@mauss_les_1936, for instance, set out to study the ways in which people of different communities and throughout history use their bodies differently.
He noticed and began documenting the resting postures, the attitudes, the ways of walking, of swimming, or of sleeping, that different communities adopt, pass on to their offspring, and evolve through time.
Mauss's observations of the evolution of practices bring us to the first general question raised by culture:
while it is clear that the culture of a community changes over time (notice how the past is sometimes described as just another foreign country), the way it changes is remarkably slow and gradual.
On one side, we know that a culture is transmitted in some form or other, as newer generations of a community grow into a pre-existing set of habits, practices and ideas, or as interacting people of the same generation influence each other's behaviours.
On the other side, it is not at all clear what exactly is transmitted between people, either in a given generation or from one generation to the next.
@durkheim_suicide:_2012, for instance, started his seminal study by puzzling at the regularity of suicide rates over the years, and at the correlation of those rates with social variables such as religion.
How does the stability of such phenomena come about, and what are the regularities in the changes that occur?
The relative stability of cultures is all the more surprising given that, in everyday life, few activities seem to be actively transmitting anything at all.
Of course we sometimes imitate behaviours that we observe in someone else, and many education-related activities explicitly aim to transmit a particular skill or body of knowledge (though hardly anything explicitly related to suicide).
But most routine interactions are not concerned with the conservation or transmission of anything, and it seems that aspects of a culture can be stable without ever being explicitly taught.
Defining what culture is, then, immediately poses the question of what mechanisms underlie its transmission and gradual change.


#### Interaction of cultural and non-cultural aspects

Mauss also asked what part psychological mechanisms play in the development of cultural practices, and what influence such practices have in turn on psychological mechanisms.
This brings us to the second matter that arises when attempting to separate what is cultural from what is not:
how does each aspect influence the other?
In particular, if cultural and non-cultural aspects have different transmission mechanisms, how do they interact with each other?

Mauss saw that cultural practices are intimately linked to the physiology of bodies, on one side, and to a community's history on the other, but also to inherited psychological mechanisms;
indeed, he considered cultural practices to be complete *physio-psycho-sociological* phenomena.
Durkheim on the other hand gave more autonomy to sociological facts.
He argued for instance that suicide, because of its continuity over time and its dependency on social variables, should be viewed as a *social fact*:
a phenomenon which, in spite of manifesting itself individually, has emerging properties in large groups, with a causal life at the level of other emergent social phenomena and causal effects on the psychological mechanisms of the members of a community.
Mauss proposed a somewhat different focus.
For him, cultural practices are embodied properties of organisms, incorporated through the everyday actions of a community, into which children grow by imitation, teaching, or other kinds of learning.
Because of this embodied nature of cultural practices, he argued, bodily capacities cannot be defined without referring to culture.
Walking, for instance, becomes difficult to define in a standard or general way:
there is no normal way of walking, there are only *ways* of walking.
By living with different bodily practices, different communities develop different bodies, none of which are standard.
Indeed, most of the techniques of the body documented by Mauss play a role in the physiological and psychological development of people growing into them, with noticeable effects such as making one able to sleep while standing or horse-riding.
Thus, while Durkheim and Mauss would not necessarily agree on the causal autonomy of culture from physiology or psychological mechanisms, both agree (unsurprisingly) that there are strong interactions between cultural practices, individual physiology, and psychological mechanisms.

In our previous introduction of the question of cultural change, we used a definition of culture as those aspects of life that vary more, or faster, across (human or non-human) communities, to be contrasted with those which vary less, or more slowly.
Most definitions of culture nowadays make a stronger claim:
they consider that culture is that which is not universal in a given species, and contrast it with that which is biologically determined (or constrained) and thus common to all members of the species.
In this case, biological determination refers to the way the genome constrains the physiological and cognitive development of an organism in a normal viable environment.
Let us then call this the *culture-as-non-genetic* definition.
Since the details of such genetic determination, and more importantly its theoretical import, are contentious issues, in this thesis we will remain with a definition in terms of higher and lower variability.
However, the culture-as-non-genetic definition has the advantage of making the question of the reciprocal influence of culture and non-culture more explicit and relatable to Mauss's and Durkheim's concerns.
The question translates to, first, how body and cognition influence culture and cultural change, and second, how cultural change influences the environment and the interactions in which an organism develops, both physiologically and cognitively.
Since environmental changes can have effects on the way the body and cognitive capacities of an organism develop, such influence can create feedback loops between physiological and cognitive development, on one side, and cultural change on the other.
The problem, then, is that such feedback loops may be so intricate that it becomes difficult or impossible to differentiate what is cultural from what is not, eventually questioning the utility of a cultural versus non-cultural separation in the first place.

\bigskip

In this thesis we empirically study an application of the first question:
we ask about the details of short-term cultural change in the case of linguistic utterances, whose evolution we observe in short transmission chains online and in controlled experiments.
However, we will see that this study case is not entirely isolated from the second question:
the issue of how cognition and culture depend on each other will reappear once we turn to the role of linguistic meaning in the short-term evolution of utterances.
In the two subsections that follow ([@sec:intro-culture-evo;@sec:intro-culture-empirical]), then, we present the theoretical and empirical approaches on which our work is based.
These approaches argue that cultural and non-cultural evolution can be studied as *gene-culture co-evolution*, which separates two parallel but interacting evolutionary processes:
biological evolution based on genetic inheritance, and cultural evolution based on cultural transmission mechanisms.
They further flesh out the details of cultural evolution, thus proposing a theoretical answer to the first question.
It is this proposal which we aim to empirically assess in the case of linguistic utterances.
In the section that follows this one (@sec:intro-cogsoc), we briefly present works that qualify the conceptual distinction between cultural and non-cultural aspects of life, and suggest that instead of a co-evolution with two parallel channels, several additional channels or a continuity of channels could be necessary.
While we will not explicitly rely on these works in the following chapters, the debate they are part of is a useful piece of context for the final discussion of our results.


### Cultural evolution {#sec:intro-culture-evo}

Today's study of cultural stability and change is heavily influenced by proponents from cognitive science and biology.
Inspired by the generality of the populational approach underlying contemporary evolutionary theory, a wave of theories of cultural stability and change developed throughout the eighties and nineties by adopting the culture-as-non-genetic definition and proposing a blend of three fundamental components to study it:

(a) Standard evolutionary theory to describe the evolution of gene frequencies (i.e., non-cultural evolution),
(b) Insights that the application of generalised evolutionary principles may, or may not, bring to the study of cultural stability and change,
(c) A construal of the two processes of change, genetic and cultural, as parallel evolutions that actively interact, notably through cognitive mechanisms, learning, and environmental engineering.

The combination of (a) and (b) is not new, as a similar inspiration underlay the development of memetics [@dawkins_selfish_2006].
\(b) can be fleshed out in different manners however.
Memetics, for instance, suggested that the full details of the neo-darwinian synthesis could be applied to culture:
it considered culture as a collection of particles (memes, the cultural counterpart of genes) that are transmitted from person to person with random variation, and differentially reproduced because of their competition for attention.
The new wave, which we will call *cultural evolutionist*, is not committed to such a genetic view of culture:
for these approaches culture need not be particulate, and the way cultural things change when they are transmitted or learned is by no means random.
Mostly, cultural evolutionists suggest that it can be useful to study how much cultural change differs from or is similar to genetic change, and then to apply only the analytical tools which remain valid in light of that comparison (if any).
Tim Lewens clarifies the position of this new wave regarding previous evolutionary approaches to culture:

> "Cultural evolutionists frequently begin their theorizing from a starting point that does not invite use of the meme concept, and may therefore appear neutral regarding its propriety. Their project is to integrate various forms of learning into evolutionary theory, in a way that leaves open the degree to which learning has anything in common with genetic inheritance."
> [@lewens_cultural_2012 p. 466]

Finally, the addition of (c) is another important difference between the new wave and previous darwinian approaches to culture:
not only can general evolutionary principles be useful to the study of culture itself, but culture and genes can also be seen as bearers of two different types of information, transmitted across generations through two parallel channels.
The way changes occur in each transmission channel leads to evolution of genes and culture at different time scales;
furthermore, since culture can have an effect on the environment in which genetic mutations are selected for, and since genes constrain the organisms that bear and transmit culture, the two evolutionary processes interact and become co-evolutionary.
The way genetic and cultural evolutionary processes interact has been studied in two parallel approaches, which @sterelny_cultural_2017 terms the Californian and the Parisian traditions.


#### Californian

@cavalli-sforza_cultural_1981 were the first to provide a detailed articulation of these three components:
evolutionary theory, evolutionary principles applied to culture, and the co-evolution of the two.
They did so by building on the fact that an evolutionary process need not be mediated by genetic transmission to take place.
Indeed, as @lewontin_cultural_1982 synthesises, evolution can happen whenever a population of items has the following three characteristics:

- There exists a transmission process by which a new item correlates to the initial item it was created from (e.g. the phenotype of an offspring depends on the phenotype of the parent)
- There is variation in the properties of items in the population,
- Items survive and spread differentially depending on these varying properties.

By looking at genetic models of evolution as a special case of these general principles of evolution, @cavalli-sforza_cultural_1981 developed the mathematical analysis of purely phenotypic transmission, which can take different paths in a given population:
vertical (from parent to offspring), oblique (from a non-parent member of the previous generation to a member of the next generation), horizontal (inside one generation), or any combination thereof.
@boyd_culture_1985 [-@boyd_origin_2005] further developed this line, leading to the formulation of *Standard Cultural Evolution* (hereafter SCE) which offers a systematic analysis of part of the interactions between cultural and genetic evolution.
This approach is now vibrant with empirical work [see @acerbi_if_2015 for a review of recent studies].

A notable feature of this programme is that it does not constrain itself into a particular view of culture.
While the main authors define culture as "information that people acquire from others by teaching, imitation, and other forms of social learning" [@boyd_origin_2005, p. 3], the mathematical models they develop can be used without giving too much conceptual strength to the notion of cultural information itself (which is difficult to define).
Indeed, their results are based on the correlation of behaviours because *something* is transmitted across individuals in a community, not on an ontological claim about the nature of what exactly is being transmitted.
The approach also has strong links to works that qualify the conceptual distinction between non-genetic and genetic aspects of life [in particular through the analysis of niche construction, to which we come back later on].
It is thus a central theory for the study of how cultural and non-cultural aspects of life interact.
In this thesis, however, we will mostly focus on the Parisian approach to cultural evolution, which we can now present in more detail.


#### Parisian {#sec:intro-review-parisian}

In the mid-nineties Dan Sperber formalised a second influential approach to the question of cultural stability and change:
in a series of innovative articles gathered in @sperber_explaining_1996, the author puts forward a research programme called *Epidemiology of Representations* (better known today as *Cultural Attraction Theory*, hereafter noted CAT), and seeks to provide the cognitive and social sciences with a common framework with which to address interdisciplinary matters such as cultural evolution.
One of the guiding questions of Sperber's work is the following:
how can we explain the relative stability of cultures through time despite the fact that most interactions between human beings seem to be transmitting very little (if anything at all) about a community's culture?
In developing an answer, Sperber commits himself to presenting a coherent ontology to define culture and identify exactly what is transmitted in human interactions, while at the same time connecting with the many ontologies he identifies in anthropology.

Sperber suggests that culture can be defined with a simple ontology made of *representations*.
Representations can be *mental*, as defined and studied by cognitive science, or can be expressed as *public* representations in diverse cultural artefacts such as pieces of text, utterances, pictures, myths, built structures, et caetera.
New mental representations are constantly formed in people's minds whenever they perceive or interpret public representations.
For instance, say I am thinking of a tune (mental representation), and I whistle it (public representation);
someone else hears it, and forms their own mental representation.
Most of the time, the new representation in that person's head is different from my original representation.
^[The recognition that representations change so much when they are transmitted through human interactions is a defining feature of the theory Sperber proposes, in contrast to memetics and to the Californian approach outlined above [@sperber_explaining_1996, p. 25-26, 31].
]

On this basis, Sperber proposes to model human communities as large dynamical systems of people continuously interpreting public representations into mental representations, and producing new public representations through their situated actions, in which mental representations play a role.
Culture, he then suggests, can be seen as the pool of representations that circulate in a given community, and studying the stability and change of a culture amounts to describing the *epidemiology of representations* in a community.
In other words, to explain culture in this framework is to describe the processes by which representations circulate through a society, leading certain strains to spread more or less widely as they are transmitted and transformed by individual interactions.
The exact processes that lead representations to spread or change can be extremely varied, as representations themselves correspond to diverse cultural domains.
A military technique, for instance, is transmitted and transformed through different processes than the ones at work for the transmission of, say, a particular game at school.
The first involves military instruction, a hierarchy of members, explicit knowledge bases and so on, while the second involves informal imitation and daily interactions of children playing with each other during school breaks.
Still, the basic ontology remains grounded in the unique notion of mental representations from cognitive science.

By developing such an ontology to connect disciplines, Sperber proposes a credible bridge between the notions of representation in social science and that of mental representation in cognitive science, without reducing one area to the other or making simplistic assumptions about the phenomena encountered.
Using an ontologically clear notion of representation is a useful step, Sperber argues, as the notions of representation in social science are so diverse that no common definition can be be agreed upon;
instead, the cognitive notion of representation can be used to unify the various notions already studied in social science [@sperber_explaining_1996 p. 16, 24-25, 33, 61-63, 78-80].
In this sense, his proposal is that of a naturalistic ontology for the study of culture which builds on cognitive science principles, while at the same time recognising the diversity of cultural phenomena to be studied.
It is thus amenable to anthropology, and encourages the combination of the two bodies of knowledge with clear definitions.
Sperber can then rephrase interdisciplinary questions in terms of spread and transformation of representations.
In particular, the question of how culture remains relatively stable through time can be reformulated as follows:
Why do some representations spread much more than others in a given community, remaining stable at the population level in spite of being repeatedly transformed by individual interactions?
Such representations, called *cultural representations*, can be taken to characterise the culture of a given community (for instance clothing habits, eating customs or values, or technological knowledge).
Thus, in the epidemiological framework proposed by Sperber, the question of cultural stability and change is the question of the stability of cultural representations at the population level.

To answer this question, Sperber introduces an additional concept:
the dynamical system of representations which models a community's culture exhibits attractors, called *cultural attractors*, that depend on the complex interaction of psychological and ecological factors in the transmission of representations, and on the distribution of representations at a given moment in time [@sperber_explaining_1996, p. 106-118].
A cultural attractor is thus a region in representation space towards which representations tend to come closer whenever they are transformed in an interaction.
Such attraction can be due a variety of factors.
The tale of Little Red Riding Hood, for instance, could have remained stable through time because of an attractor due to basic cognitive mechanisms favouring a particular structure in the story.
The recipe for Mornay sauce could be stable through time because of constraints on the way it is taught, and the physical possibilities to realise the mixture of ingredients.
To take yet another example, the practice of smoking can be seen as exhibiting two natural attractors:
either not smoking at all, or developing a dependency and smoking around 25 cigarettes a day [@claidiere_role_2007].
Note that distribution of representations in a community depends not only on attractors, but on where new representations come from and where they disappear.
In the case of smoking, one can imagine a constant flow of people starting to smoke about 10 cigarettes a day, and gradually being attracted to 0 or 25 a day, such that the steady-state distribution of smoking behaviours is rather flat from 0 to 25 cigarettes a day [@claidiere_role_2007].
Cultural attractors are therefore one of the core concepts of CAT, as they provide intelligibility to the evolution of culture and to the reciprocal influence of psychology, culture, and environment.
As such, a central goal in the CAT research stream has been to identify existing attractors, and explain their emergence based on the interaction of psychological and ecological factors.

The most important intuition in Sperber's proposal, and what differentiates it from previous works, is the centrality of individual psychology for the evolution of culture and its role in the emergence of attractors [@sperber_explaining_1996, p. 31].
He substantiates this by relying heavily on contemporary cognitive science, and in particular by adopting and extending the view of the modularity of mind initially defended by @fodor_modularity_1983 (his view goes further than Fodor's, as he argues for a *massive modularity of mind* applying not only to perception but also to conceptual processes).
Combining this view with epidemiology of representations, Sperber argues, results in a theory that avoids two common pitfalls.
On one side, the abstract approach to representations considers that it is possible to completely study culture without going into the details of individual cognitive processes;
this approach has obvious problems with known constraints about the way our cognitive system works, and with our own intuition of how easy or difficult it is to learn certain practices or certain ideas [@sperber_explaining_1996, p. 63-66].
Taking into account the role of psychological constraints is also not incompatible with an account of the diversity of cultures as observed in ethnography [@sperber_explaining_1996, chap. 6].
On the other side, naive applications of neo-darwinist formalism to the specific case of culture (such as memetics) are a grotesque simplification of the details of culture, and of the diversity of interactions and domains that exist in the world [@sperber_explaining_1996, p. 101].

---

This specificity of CAT is often highlighted as one of the main differences with SCE [@sterelny_cultural_2017, p. 47];
CAT is nonetheless compatible with the framework of gene-culture co-evolution developed by SCE [@sperber_explaining_1996, p. 114], and most authors consider that both theories are compatible but focus on slightly different questions [@sterelny_cultural_2017; @acerbi_if_2015].

- it converged with SCE

The space opened by the development of SCE and CAT has generated much debate [see e.g. the peer commentary to @mesoudi_towards_2006] and some heated criticisms [@ingold_trouble_2007; answered in @mesoudi_science_2007; @lewens_cultural_2012 p. 461-2 provides further discussion and context].
[@Sec:intro-review-developments;@sec:intro-review-criticisms] come back to these debates and criticisms, which I group into two broad categories.
The first concerns the specifics of the evolutionary approach adopted by SCE and CAT:
what evolutionary mechanisms should they take into account (for instance niche construction, or epigenetic or extended inheritance) and, correspondingly, how long the restriction of inheritance to two isolated and parallel channels will remain the best approximation.
The second critique concerns what @thompson_mind_2007 has termed the "informational dualism" of the notion of representation in cognitive science:
at the concrete level, it questions whether a representationalist approach can naturalise meaning, a core aspect in the analysis of culture and life;
at the programmatic level it suggests that, compared to the focus on dynamic couplings that Thompson and his colleagues develop under the "enactive approach" banner, a focus on representations in cognitive science has less heuristic value in guiding the exploration of the interactions between culture and psychology.
Regardless of whether proponents can reconcile SCE and CAT with the second critique, I believe both approaches can benefit greatly from these debates, and that empirical study has a crucial role to play in exploring the implications of each side.


#### Empirical exploration of the Parisian approach

The empirical exploration of CAT has proven a difficult task, for two main reasons.
First, Sperber clarifies that CAT is not, and should not be, a "grand unitary theory":

> "An epidemiological approach ... should not hope for one grand unitary theory. It should, rather, try to provide interesting questions and useful conceptual tools, and to develop the different models needed to explain the existence and fate of the various families of cultural representations." [@sperber_explaining_1996, p. 83]

Indeed, CAT accomplishes this:

> "What the epidemiological analogy suggests is a general approach, types of questions to ask, ways of constructing concepts, and a plurality of not too grand theoretical aims." [@sperber_explaining_1996, p. 61]

As a consequence, testing CAT means evaluating the fruitfulness of its paradigm.
No single study, or collection of studies for that matter, will reach a yes or no answer to the validity of CAT.
Still, we can reach a collective consensus about the usefulness of approaching the psychology-culture link with the tools and questions developed by that theory.

As the name CAT indicates, an important part of that toolbox is the notion of cultural attractor, which is amenable to empirical study:
the presence or absence of a well-defined attractor in a given situation can be turned into a testable hypothesis.
Additionally, at the meta-analytical level one can readily evaluate the usefulness of a cultural attraction approach in concrete domains, by analysing whether or not the questions it encourages result in fruitful studies, on average, for that domain.
In short, while testing CAT empirically is not a simple matter of yes or no, the theory provides a clear set of tools and lines of thought that are well worth evaluating in a wider, programmatic appraisal.

The second challenge to empirical exploration resides in the fact that quantitative data on out-of-laboratory cultural artefacts is not easy to collect.
Although theoretical models to guide that exploration are gradually appearing [@claidiere_role_2007; @claidiere_how_2014], developing methods for the quantitative study of attractors is still an open problem.
The literature on CAT shows at least two important methods that have been used up to now.
First, the meta-analysis of large numbers of anthropological or historical works, which has uncovered several relevant effects.
The way portraits are painted over the centuries, for instance, has been shown to increasingly favour direct- versus oblique-gaze portraying [@morin_how_2013].
@miton_universal_2015 also used this technique to propose an explanation for the historical stability of the bloodletting practice, in spite of its medical ineffectiveness.
Exploiting similar records, @baumard_increased_2015 showed a link between the evolution of religious values and the affluence of societies in which they develop.

A second approach is to reproduce the evolution of content with human or animal participants in the laboratory, where subjects repeatedly transmit or interact around pieces of content initially chosen by the experimenters.
The resulting data is an approximation of the rapid evolution of artefacts in real life, yet in a controlled situation that can then be statistically analysed with access to all the parameters.
This technique has been used in studies ranging from the evolution of visual patterns transmitted in a group of apes [@claidiere_cultural_2014], to the role of argumentation in the transmission of solutions to simple but counter-intuitive reasoning problems [@claidiere_argumentation_2017].
A number of other disciplines have developed methods that can be relevant to the study of CAT and SCE, and I review these in the next subsection (@sec:intro-culture-empirical).

\bigskip

While authors have acknowledged that there is no core incompatibility between CAT and SCE [@acerbi_if_2015; @sterelny_cultural_2017] and a growing number of social scientists is discussing both approaches positively [see the comments to @mesoudi_towards_2006; and @slingerland_what_2008], the work I present in this thesis is mainly focused on CAT itself, and less so SCE.
While the prevalence of the cultural attraction approach in the French academic landscape naturally had an impact on this choice, I see three other arguments for focusing on CAT.
First, it puts cognitive science squarely in the middle of the problem because of the importance of psychology for the study culture.
I admit to sharing that opinion (and given current evidence, it is not more than an opinion).
Second, its initial goal is not so much to develop a mathematical theory of culture (which will surely flourish in due time), but to interest all disciplines studying human life in a common framework by using *principled philosophical arguments*.
Third, this approach in turn leads to a clear articulation of the philosophical principles defended, discussed, and tested by the theory at the cultural and cognitive levels.^[
  In the words of Tim Ingold, an outspoken critic of both CAT and SCE: "[Sperber's work] has the virtue of rendering unusually explicit the assumptions built into much contemporary theorising about culture and cognition, and of driving them through to their logical conclusions" [@ingold_transmission_2001, p. 113].
]
As such, it seems that CAT is in a good position to generate productive debate between alternative approaches (such as the propositions coming from social anthropology, and those discussed in @sec:intro-review-criticisms) which, at the moment, are still competing on the principled level.
In particular, the challenges that arise when attempting to study CAT experimentally, as will be the case here for linguistic utterances, should prove helpful in developing a path to the resolution of the critiques faced by both CAT and SCE.


### Empirical work {#sec:intro-culture-empirical}

A number of adjacent disciplines have developed interest in and contributed to CAT.
Simulations and experimental studies of the evolution of morality [@baumard_mutualistic_2013], religion [@boyer_religion_2001], or reasoning [@claidiere_argumentation_2017; @mercier_why_2011] have applied the theory;
studies on the evolution of language, and of online content through digital media, are also part of this cluster.
The latter two areas are particularly relevant for applying CAT to the evolution of linguistic material, as they have already explored factors in this process for a variety of domains, as well as conditions under which gradual changes can build up cumulatively, and the role that such accumulation plays in long term evolution.
Essential to these studies are the serial reproduction paradigm and its derivatives, better known today as transmission chains and micro-societies, which have all been used extensively in recent works.


#### The versatile serial reproduction paradigm

The serial reproduction paradigm was first applied in a series of influential studies on memorisation and recall by @bartlett_remembering:_1995, who was experimenting with ways of reproducing the evolution of content through its iterated production by and transmission to different people, under somewhat more controlled conditions than what can be achieved in field work.
The paradigm was only one among several other techniques introduced by Bartlett, but it came to have a lasting impact on later studies linking memory to culture.
Similar to a game of Chinese Whispers, people participate in a chain along which content is transmitted;
the experimenter gives a first participant initial material, typically a picture or a short piece of text, with instructions to read or memorise it;
that participant is later asked to recall or reproduce the material, and the experimenter uses their output as input for the next participant, thus constructing a chain of successive memorisation (or perception) and recollection (or reproduction) of the initial material.
Participants may or may not know that they are part of a chain.
The setup approximates the transmission and change process that happens in everyday life, and while it is quite idealised and imperfect it allows experimenters to explore effects of different factors on the process, and examine the evolution of the artefacts produced as a trace or signal of the overall phenomenon at work.

Important independent variables that may vary include the chain structure (e.g. the number and sources of preceding recollections a participant is exposed to), the reading or memorising instructions and context, the interval between exposition and recall, the possible task given during that interval (or, conversely, a possible overlap of exposition and recall, turning the task into copying, or online interaction between participants), the recall instructions and context, the ordering and organisation of participants in the chain, or the ordering of the content itself in the chain (e.g. is a given participant exposed to material from a single generation all in one go, or to material successively sampled from random generations).
Typical studies will then analyse the trends in the transformation of artefacts that were produced, possibly comparing the behaviour across different chains.
When faced with the complexities of quantitatively analysing the content itself, studies often opt to contrast a simpler measure (such as rate of change) across two different populations, two conditions in the independent variables mentioned above, or two minimally different types of content.
In CAT parlance, this method corresponds to the simplest instantiation of the causal chains of public representation to mental representation to public representation (and so on) described by @sperber_explaining_1996 [p. 99], and has thus garnered much attention in the literature related to cultural attraction.

Early work contemporary to Bartlett's applied the technique in a variety of settings.
A first stream of research explored ways in which verbal memory and social or cultural background can interact.
@maxwell_remembering_1936, for instance, contrasted the evolution of a story containing deliberate inconsistencies in groups of different social status and age such as soldiers, priests, educated men or women, students, or boy scouts.
He found indications that different groups shortened the story at different rates, and conserved or transformed different pieces of the initial story.
@northway_influence_1936 also contrasted the conservation of story parts across groups of children from schools with different social backgrounds, relating the proportion of good recollections of a given item to the everyday activities of the children, or the types of transformations (addition, recasting, modification) to the different age groups and to the diversity of backgrounds in a given group.
A later stream of research focused more on pictorial content, such as @ward_experiment_1949 who related a record of European coin types from 4th to 1st century B.C. to the trends obtained by Bartlett in serial reproduction of pictures.
He confirmed that what Bartlett called "representative detached details", that is parts of a picture that represent a distinctive pattern or object even when isolated from the whole, are well preserved both in artificial and historical serial reproductions.
Ward thus suggested that comparing historical data to results of serial reproduction experiments can be a useful method to investigate the influence of universal-psychological versus local-cultural factors in theories of historical evolution of artefacts.
@hall_effect_1950 further explored hypotheses made by Bartlett on the effect of titles for pictorial and verbal serial reproduction:
in those new experiments, it appeared that titles had a considerable influence on the reproduction of both pictures and texts, by acting as an interpretive frame that guides (or confuses) the participants in interpreting the material.^[
  Hall, noting that "the function of the headline or title to some story or article is that of giving a particular emphasis to certain aspects of the text, and is one of the main methods of distorting and biasing what is remembered" [@hall_effect_1950, p. 120], later reflects on the fact that such results have crucial political implications given the development of mass media.
]
More recently the reliability of Bartlett's studies has been discussed, shifting the focus towards a better control of experimental conditions:
@gauld_experiments_1967, while still praising Bartlett for the progress that his work represented compared to that of his predecessors, showed that changing the exposition instructions, for instance by giving strict memorisation instructions, or by adding a simple sentence asking participants to be "accurate", would considerably reduce the transformation rate in the resulting chains, a fact that should question the effects measured by a setup that lacks explicit memorisation instructions.
The authors also examined the level of conscientiousness of participants in accomplishing their task, showing that the measure correlated negatively to the participants' transformation rate.
Noting that the effect was not explained away by a measure of intelligence of participants, they finally suggested that "errors could, it seemed, be avoided, if the subject was so inclined" [-@gauld_experiments_1967, p. 45].
Today, one overcomes such an issue by designing experiments that create an intrinsic motivation for participants to adopt the behaviour under study [see @claidiere_argumentation_2017 for an example].
In contemporary work, @kashima_recovering_2000 offered a reappraisal of the social aspect of Bartlett's contributions.
Kashima argues that while Bartlett's legacy is mostly seen in psychological studies that adopt methodological individualism, Bartlett fiercely opposed that approach;
indeed, his view of the interaction of culture and psychology had much in common with views from social science such as those evoked in @sec:intro-review-social, and with today's social psychology view of a deeper integration between culture and biology.

One recurrent problem, found across most of the above studies, is the difficulty of quantitatively analysing meaning in the material transmitted along chains.
@northway_influence_1936, through her focus on meaningfulness, @hall_effect_1950 [p. 120] and @gauld_experiments_1967 [p. 42] all indicate that analysing content itself is a laudable but yet unreachable goal.
In facing that difficulty, studies recur to analyses of form, survival, or other measurable aspects of the participants' productions.
For linguistic material for instance:
the length of a recollection, the number of words, concepts, or propositions accurately recalled, or a contrast of the concepts conserved at the end of the chains.
Today the problem remains, and contemporary studies of meaningful material use the same techniques to index or approximate changes in the content of artefacts produced (indeed, the work presented in this thesis will be no exception).
While much progress can be made by using these approaches to quantifying aspects of the material, or by instead focusing on artefacts that bear no content, it seems a consensual account of meaning, and a corresponding means of analysis, will be necessary for a full-fledged theory of cultural change to establish itself.
I will return to this issue in @sec:intro-problems.


#### Contemporary revival

Owing to the development of SCE and CAT, the last two decades have seen a regain of interest for the serial reproduction paradigm (now known as a transmission chain) and its derivatives (generally known as cultural transmission experiments), resulting in the development of new case studies and methodologies.
A number of effects have been catalogued by recent works.
@bangerter_transformation_2000, for instance, showed that in transmitting a scientifically styled account of human sexual reproduction, participants tended to personify ovum and sperm, and attribute stereotypical gender roles to them.
@mesoudi_hierarchical_2004 have argued that the loss of detail that is repeatedly observed in transmission chains, and in particular in the transmission of reports of everyday events, is due to a hierarchical encoding of memories that biases participants' recollections in favour of higher-level descriptions.
Works studying the evolution of religion have focused on the effect of counter-intuitive information:
by studying transmission chains of stories made of elements with varying degrees of counter-intuitiveness, @barrett_spreading_2001 and @norenzayan_memory_2006 observed a conservation advantage for minimally counter-intuitive elements which supports the eponymous Minimal Counter-Intuitiveness account of religion [@boyer_religion_2001; and see @purzycki_mci_2016 for a critical discussion].
Other similar transmission advantages have been identified in relation to stereotypes:
for instance, elements of a story that are consistent with gender stereotypes are less degraded than elements that are inconsistent with such stereotypes, but only when relevant to the story plot [@kashima_maintaining_2000];
stories made of social information, that is featuring human interactions and plots, are also better transmitted than stories involving non-interacting people or than stories about physical nonhuman elements alone [@mesoudi_bias_2006].
The extensive reviews provided by @mesoudi_multiple_2008 and @whiten_cultural_2016 give a broader idea of the effects studied and methods used in the literature.

\add{bebbington-sky-2017, stubbersfield-serial-2015}

A more recent stream of research explicitly focuses on the individual transmission step in a chain.
For instance, setups with two parallel chains that cross-fertilise each other have been shown to improve transmission rates [@eriksson_advantage_2012]:
if at each generation, the participants of two parallel chains both receive two inputs, one from each chain at the previous generation, information loss is decreased compared to a single chain where participants read twice the same piece of content (of the previous generation).
@acerbi_role_2016 further modelled such error-correcting redundancy, simulating minimal scenarios that could favour its evolution given fixed cost-reward constraints.
@eriksson_corpses_2014 also decomposed real world transmission into three phases:
choose-to-receive, encode-and-retrieve, and choose-to-transmit.
Focusing on emotional selection studies showing that participants are more willing to pass on stimuli that elicit disgust [@heath_emotional_2001], the authors showed that any of those phases can be the target of a selection pressure.
Such pressures can additionally counteract each other, showing that the transmission process is more complex than was initially assumed.
Studies of digital media have adopted the increased level of detail, as digital communication lets users copy-paste and bypass the encode-and-retrieve phase of transmission [@acerbi_cultural_2016].

Methodological exploration has also led to more free-form interaction setups:
in a study of the transmission of risk perception, @moussaid_amplification_2015 chose to make the interaction and underlying transmission of information an open-ended process.
After initiating a chain by providing the first participant with a set of documents to read on their own, later participants were left to talk freely in successive dyads, and the whole session was recorded on film for subsequent analysis.
An analogous change of setup was operated by @caldwell_studying_2008 [-@caldwell_experimental_2008] who investigated the cumulative aspect of the evolution of building techniques in a series of experiments asking participants to construct spaghetti towers or paper planes, later evaluated by their height and flight distance.
A crucial point in those setups, Sterelny notes [-@sterelny_cultural_2017, n. 12], is that participants could observe the preceding generation during their experimenting and building, meaning they had access to rich context for the learning phase of transmission.
Taking another step to embrace interaction with a setup where participants had to repeatedly build Lego cars in pairs (though without transmission), @mcgraw_cultures_2014 take the complete joint interaction to be their object of study and propose to use the constructions resulting from interacting dyads as a trace of the processes that took place in the interaction.
By looking at the characteristics of the cars built by participants, the authors claim to present "methods for discerning, and quantifying, schema-like intersubjective understandings in material form" [@mcgraw_cultures_2014, p. 4; see also @mitkidis_building_2015; and @wallot_beyond_2016], effectively integrating critiques that I discuss below in @sec:intro-review-criticisms.

The works reviewed here show that there is much room for exploration, on one side, of the methodological choices in transmission chain experiments (some of which will turn out to be more important than others in the trends observed), and on the other, of the theoretical background that sustains a given study.
Such experiments have therefore much to bring to underlying theoretical debates.


#### Language change: Experimental semiotics and Iterated learning

\add{tamariz-experimental-2017}

A related strand of research has developed similar methods to study the emergence and evolution of language.
A central experimental paradigm is that of iterated learning, which resembles a transmission chain for artificial languages where participants learn a communication system at each step:
a first group of participants must learn to use a simple artificial language (e.g. an artificial vocabulary for naming a range of objects), after which a second group of participants must learn that language through some interaction with or transmission from the first group.
The process is then iterated over successive generations, leading to the evolution of the artificial language initially introduced.
A related setup used in experimental semiotics surfaces the evolution of interaction without transmission across generations.
It consists in pairing participants and assigning them a task that they must cooperatively solve over repeated iterations, without changing partners.
Most often, participants can use a communication channel (or must create it) to help in coordination, such that the setup exposes the way participants iteratively develop conventions over the channel.
Studies using these two paradigms have shown that simple biases in participants' interactions and learning capabilities can lead the final evolved communication system to exhibit non-trivial structure.
Several factors have been shown to influence the process, including the structure of the objects referred to by the artificial language, the transmission or interaction task (and its surrounding context) for iterated learning, and the reinforcement rules favouring expressivity of the language that will interact with learnability pressures.

A first major goal in this stream is to provide an non-nativist account of the emergence an structure of communication systems [@kirby_innateness_2007].
@galantucci_experimental_2005, for instance, studied pairs of participants facing a cooperative task that required them to develop ad hoc communication conventions.
The communication channel, a form of shared whiteboard, distorted participants' input by a constant drift such that they could not enter letters or pictorial drawings.
The study highlighted the variety of strategies used by participants to develop conventional sign systems, and in particular the way those systems were adapted to the interaction history of dyads.
The authors showed that sign systems were deeply meshed with the situated and time-dependent information that was available, allowing the participants to solve their task by dynamically coordinating [@galantucci_experimental_2005, pp. 748-749].
Further stripping down the set of assumptions built into the experimental setup, @scott-phillips_signalling_2009 created a cooperative task without providing any communication channel parallel to the task itself.
To solve the challenge, participants had to develop a communication system where their own behaviour in the task could become an embodied communicative signal, aside from accomplishing their action for the task either simultaneously or at other times.
Here too, the authors underline the importance of developing a dialogue, based on common ground provided by the history of interactions, to bootstrap the creation of a general communication system that can solve the task in all situations.
These studies show that communication systems are inherently embodied and situated, but still involve some degree of intentional design by the participants.

Iterated learning setups, on the other side, have focused on the unintentional emergence of structure.
@kirby_cumulative_2008, for instance, studied the evolution of an initially random artificial vocabulary set which participants had to learn, use, and extrapolate to name events (events were a combination of a shape, a colour, and a movement).
By filtering ambiguities in the output vocabulary produced by one participant and given to the next, the authors were able to create a pressure for expressivity of the complete vocabulary;
combined with the learnability pressure inherent to the task, and the fact that participants had to extrapolate to unknown events, the vocabulary gradually evolved to regularise variation with the emergence of compositionality corresponding to the three dimensions of the events to name.
Crucially, the participants were not aware of the goals of the experiment, nor that they were part of a chain:
the emergent structure in the vocabulary thus appeared without intentional design.
Using a comparable setup where participants had to extrapolate a colour-naming vocabulary, a subset of which was then transmitted to the next generation, @xu_cultural_2013 observed that (probably culture-specific) biases in colour grouping played an important role in the convergence of vocabulary terms.
Combinatorial structure and distinctiveness has also been shown to emerge in a set of acoustic signals devoid of meaning that participants had to learn and reproduce [@verhoef_emergence_2014].
@cornish_systems_2013 encountered similar results for sequences of categorical items that had no inherent meaning:
since participants must reproduce a whole set of sequences, or acoustic signals, at each generation, the set behaves as a interconnected system for which learning pressures gradually increase the combinatorial structure.

Experimental semiotics and iterated learning also cross-fertilise each other:
after @garrod_foundations_2007 used a Pictionary-like collaborative task, without transmission, to study the emergence of symbolism in a lexicon, a process they called "interactive grounding", @fay_interactive_2010 extended the findings to a micro-society.
Fay and colleagues showed that globally shared symbols can emerge through the gradual alignment of such interactive groundings, leading to an increasingly refined and streamlined symbol system.
The authors thus proposed "symbolisation" as an additional mechanism in the emergence of communication systems, based on intra-generational collaborative coordination through interaction, and parallel to the inter-generational learning biases and bottlenecks studied by iterated learning studies.
Taking another leaf from experimental semiotics, @winters_languages_2015 exploited the observation that a large part of the meaning of an utterance comes from its situational context:
they studied the influence of the situations in which participants use vocabulary items on the structure of the language that evolves from interaction and iterated learning [thus extending @silvey_word_2015].
The authors show that, if the situations in which participants communicate do not contrast items on all the dimensions on which they differ, then the vocabulary set often evolves to not encode those dimensions.
In other words, if the usage situations shield the participants from certain contrasts between items, the final vocabulary is often under-specified with respect to the full item space:
it does not encode the dimensions that discriminate the unobserved contrasts, instead adapting to be useful only for the contrasts that users observed.
This stream of research is active and gradually relaxing the constraining hypotheses made by initial studies.
@carr_cultural_2017, for instance, recently made the space of items more realistic by exploring the emergence of vocabulary sets where participants communicate about a continuous unbounded set of items.

A second, closely related question concerns how an already structured communication system evolves given a set of external, learning, or interaction pressures.
@croft_evolutionary_2013 provides a general framework for this question, inspired by principles from biological evolution and by recent debates on the nature of the evolutionary process, and crucially focused on identifying an adequate unit of analysis for the evolutionary study of language change.
Indeed the author combines two key insights.
On one side, Hull's General Analysis of Selection [@croft_evolutionary_2013, p. 16] lets him abstract out the principles of evolutionary processes and distinguish between replicator, interactor, and selection, three core components that provide "a model for disentangling different cultural evolutionary processes and identifying their interconnections" [@croft_evolutionary_2013, p. 18].
On the other side, he draws on the critique that Developmental Systems Theory opposes to a gene-centred view of biological evolution [@oyama_cycles_2001], and insists that a theory of language change should consider utterances to be full life cycles made of pronunciation, meaning, and interpretation in context.
He thus proposes the Theory of Utterance Selection, which takes linguemes (i.e. the linguistic structure of sounds, words, constructions and utterances) to be replicators, but always part of a larger cycle;
language speakers are the interactors [-@croft_evolutionary_2013, p. 16], and the theory defines language as the "population of utterances in a speech community" [-@croft_evolutionary_2013, p. 35].

A number of existing studies fit well in this framework.
@tamariz_cultural_2014, for instance, used a common setup requiring participants to develop a pictorial vocabulary for a pre-given set of words, and modelled the trends participants exhibit in adopting new signs as they go through the interactions of the experiment.
The authors found that participants do not select new signs neutrally;
rather, they tend to favour signs they have used in the past, even if their partners use different ones, unless they encounter a sign they find obviously superior in representative power.
Similarly, in a picture-description transmission chain using an artificial minimal language, @smith_eliminating_2010 showed that the accumulation of individual participant biases will regularise the marking of plurals in the evolved language.
@kirby_compression_2015, while studying the emergence of structure as the result of combined pressures of expressivity and compressibility [the latter often attributed to learning, @tamariz_culture:_2015], hint to the fact that the way structure emerges and evolves is highly dependent on the combination of such pressures.
They note, in particular, that "there is some suggestive evidence that structure in language can be modulated by the composition of populations" [@kirby_compression_2015, p. 99]:
different communication patterns at the population level, or a different fabric in the population responsible for the transmission and evolution of a language (e.g. more second-language learners, or more children learners), should lead to differences in the evolution of language structure.
Regarding symbolism, @caldwell_cultural_2012 extended the micro-society Pictionary-like task studied by @fay_interactive_2010 to one where participants were gradually replaced, inducing increased symbolism and successful transmission of the evolved symbols at the same time.
Initial members of the micro-society constructed highly iconic representations of the meanings to convey, but as the experiment introduced newcomers to those signs through observation and consequent use, the drawings gradually lost the iconic link to their referent and became simpler.

Large portions of the iterated learning literature draws on and contributes to a parallel theoretical track which laid down the first analytical predictions for models of Bayesian agents learning and producing languages in chains.
@griffiths_language_2007 were the first to show that the analytical structure of iterated learning with uniform Bayesian agents can correspond, depending on the way the agents produce new iterations, to well-known statistical inference methods (Gibbs sampling and a flavour of the EM algorithm).
In such a setup, iterated learning predictably converges towards distributions determined by the internal prior distributions of agents (i.e. their inference bias).
As a consequence, in those analytically derived situations one can straightforwardly predict the final distributions that should evolve under iterated learning, a fact that @kalish_iterated_2007 verified with humans in a function learning task.
@griffiths_using_2008 further exploit this result by using it in the reverse direction:
since the outcome of iterated learning, for specific setups, is predictable on the basis of participants' priors, one can use such experiments to investigate the inductive biases of participants.
The authors confirmed this, showing that the method infers well-known participant biases in category learning tasks.
@griffiths_theoretical_2008 then explored the relevance of these findings for the study of cultural evolution, showing in particular that individual cognitive biases can have significant effects on long-term cultural evolution.
@reali_evolution_2009 further related those results to the evolution of vocabulary, showing that they are consistent with experimental cases of word-meaning mapping regularisation.
Finally @perfors_language_2014, through analytical derivation and experimental confirmation, reintroduced the impact of the external world in those results;
the authors showed that the structure of referents (i.e., the external world) will also play a role in the final evolved language, provided it has an effect on the choice of items people actually talk about (versus, the choice of items talked about only depends on the language itself).

@scott-phillips_language_2010 and @tamariz_cultural_2016 provide further reviews of the iterated learning literature, and @galantucci_experimental_2012 and @roberts_investigating_2017 offer reviews of experimental semiotics.
An interesting and important development in recent works is the reintroduction of pragmatics into theoretical questions.
@scott-phillips_pragmatics_2017, in particular, reaffirms the central role of pragmatics in the creation and understanding of meaning in context, and argues for a much stronger focus on the evolution of pragmatics itself, that is, as he envisions it, on the evolution of *ostensive communication*.
Let me close this review by noting that there is an increasing convergence both in the literature and in empirical questions, of the cultural evolution and language evolution fields;
the intersection of questions from the two fields is likely to push theoretical issues forward.

#### Digital media

@acerbi_cultural_2016 defines digital media as "media encoded in digital format, typically to be transmitted and consumed on electronic devices, such as computers and smartphones".
The ubiquity of this medium, which created the ongoing avalanche of available digital traces, has opened both questions and possibilities for the study of cultural evolution over the past 15 years.
Indeed digital media is both a measurement tool and an object of study, as it has become embedded in everyday life in many societies, with its own practices of interaction, mediation, or transmission, possibly impacting cultural evolution.
While digital practices are different from those in physical encounters, the digital transition remains an addition to the possible range of interaction media, and the cultural evolution framework can study it as such, with increased access to the artefacts those interactions produce.
@acerbi_cultural_2016 argues precisely for such an approach to digital media, and reviews relevant works that have explored that space.
In what follows I present three areas of focus that have received particular attention in the literature.

A core---and somewhat canonical---challenge for digital media has been to describe the behaviours of diffusion and change of artefacts in social networks, and if possible predict their macroscopic spread and evolution.
The question is far from new [see @rogers_diffusion_2005] and works have historically tackled this question through analytical models, simulations and empirical studies, but the recent increase in access to digital traces and computing power to make sense of such data has boosted empirical developments.
Gathering data from blogspace, for instance, has allowed studying the propagation of information topics, as @gruhl_information_2004 did by separating topics into "chatter" and externally-triggered ("spike") subjects to model their spread over the social network formed by users.
The email network is another source of digital traces, with patterns specific to it;
indeed @liben-nowell_tracing_2008 showed that information diffusion along email chains has an unexpected deep tree-like structure, which they suggest is because of the asynchronous nature of email.
Such studies focus on *socio-semantic systems*, that is systems made of, on one side, a collection of users whose interactions or links form a social network, and on the other side, a set of topics or subjects around which the users interact, which also features a network-like structure.
The two levels of structure reciprocally influence each other, as @cointet_socio-semantic_2009 show for blogspace [see also @cointet_how_2007 who explore the relative roles of social network topology and transmission rules, related to the structure of topics in the spread of information].

The scale of the study of social networks has grown considerably over the past decade, and linguistic memes in particular have received much attention.
In a landmark endeavour, @leskovec_meme-tracking_2009 gathered and published a data set of quotes extracted from a million blogs and news outlets over a nine month period, and developed a method to group minimally different occurrences into quotation families in order to quantify the popularity of news topics over time.
The technique allowed the authors to study the evolution of the online news cycle, measuring differences in publication timings across blogs and news outlets.
@simmons_memes_2011 further analysed that data set, showing that transformations of quotes upon copy are frequent (contrary to what one would expect for such memes), work that @omodei_multi-level_2012 then extended with a more accurate multi-level transformation model.
@adamic_information_2016 developed a similar study for the evolution of explicit memes (that include instructions asking the reader to copy and pass on the contents of the meme) in a Facebook data set of hundreds of millions of occurrences;
by using a biological evolutionary model of mutation and replication where genotype corresponds to the meme's content and phenotype to the copying instructions, the authors explore the implications of pushing the biological analogy to its limits in such a paradigmatic case.
The range of empirical questions, and the technical challenges involved in tackling them, are such, that the focus has moved towards developing methods for the collection and study of similar data sets.
For instance, the MemeTracker project initiated by @leskovec_meme-tracking_2009 has now evolved into a fully-fledged network collection and analysis platform [@leskovec_snap_2014] with associated data sets [@leskovec_snap:_2016].
Another noteworthy example of this is the development by @moritz_non-literal_2016 of text re-use detection methods for historical works, a technique that could open the application of the above studies to digitised historical corpora.

A second research stream isolates the different processes involved in the spread and change of artefacts.
In particular for transformation, separating effects of content from effects of context is a necessary step to understand the processes responsible for the changes of artefacts.
@danescu-niculescu-mizil_you_2012 thus studied the memorability of movie quotes by identifying features that can predict quotes marked as memorable by users of the Internet Movie Database (call these IMDb-memorable):
from about 1000 movie scripts, the authors extracted around 2200 pairs of quotes, each consisting of one IMDb-memorable quote paired with the closest quote in the movie script that has the same length, is spoken by the same character, and is not IMDb-memorable.
By contrasting these pairs, the authors surface the content-related features of a quote that make it memorable, and factor out the context in which the quotes appear, context which otherwise plays an important role in the memorability rating.
After checking that human subjects can identify which quote in the pair is memorable (they do so with an average 78% success rate), the authors show that memorable quotes, on average, use less frequent vocabulary, more frequent grammatical categories (POS tags), and more general constructions (fewer 3^rd^ person pronouns, more indefinite articles, etc.) that make them more adaptable to changing contexts (each of these measures, taken individually, partitions the quote pairs into two subsets containing about 40% vs. 60% of the whole set).
Cancelling out context effects to develop content-related features has become a widely used approach, with adaptations ranging from the identification of linguistic markers of politeness in online content [@danescu-niculescu-mizil_computational_2013] to the measurement of attractiveness of famous quotes [@acerbi_did_2017].
In a study reminiscent of @hall_effect_1950, @acerbi_did_2017 compared the relative strength of content and presentational context in a sample of famous quotes that participants had to rate for attractiveness.
The authors compared conditions where quotes were presented alone, versus presented with random attribution to more or less famous personalities, or versus presented with a random popularity score.
They found that such minimal context has little effect if any at all:
attribution, famous or not, bears no effect on the attractiveness of a quote, and popularity has little.
@althoff_how_2014 also opened the study of context versus content to relational variables, by showing how social status and presentational features (such as showing a strong need) can affect the success of requests on Reddit.

A third related stream of research focuses more specifically on influence in social networks, and its links with attention:
what network effects trigger the diffusion of a particular meme or piece of information?
Among the micro-processes involved in the spread of information in networks, what is the role of influence across connected nodes?
@bakshy_social_2009 investigated the question of social influence by examining information cascades in Second Life.
Information cascades, where a comparatively small initial event triggers large scale diffusion, are a well-known phenomenon in social networks, and their size distribution is well modelled by peer-pressure threshold models which link the cascade behaviours to the topology of the network in which they occur [@watts_simple_2002; @ruan_kinetics_2015].
@bakshy_social_2009 thus tracked the spread of *assets* in the virtual world provided by Second Life (that is pieces of content introduced and copied by players in the game);
they find that a significant part of contagion happens along the friend network, instead of in avatar-to-avatar interactions, indicating that the adoption rate of (in-game) social circles has a strong impact on a person's adoption of an asset in Second Life [see @bakshy_everyones_2011 for another example study, on Twitter, separating the strength of content from the strength of social influence].

Attention in social networks is another related factor.
Considering the amount and constant flow of information available, filtering and attention management is a necessary component of the diffusion of artefacts;
it is usually accounted for through competition among pieces of information.
@weng_competition_2012, for instance, model the spread of Twitter hashtags through agents with bounded memory and attention, and show that such simple assumptions account well for the distribution of hashtag diffusion along the social network.
The relationship between attention and strength of ties has also been explored by @weng_attention_2015 in data gathered from Twitter, cell phone, and email networks.
In these data sets, the authors confirm that while strong ties transport the majority of events, users devote comparable attention levels to both strong and weak ties;
they suggest that strong ties play a social communication role, while users use weak ties for seeking novel information, a distinction which could explain the different attentional patterns they measure across the different media.

The empirical study of information diffusion and spread has steadily grown since the advent of digital traces;
the number of factors included in analyses is growing, and the influence of core processes such as attention is gradually becoming clearer [an interesting addition would be the role of power relationships, which are also detectable through markers of interactive behaviour, @danescu-niculescu-mizil_echoes_2011].
As mentioned above, @acerbi_cultural_2016 provides a useful overview of other works that are relevant for current questions of cultural evolution.


#### Conclusion

As I discuss in @sec:brainscopypaste, the development of data set collection and analysis methods can bring insight, as well as refined questions, to the study of the reciprocal influences between cognition and culture. \todo{"I" or "we", for BCP?}
Other empirical fields in psychology and linguistics are useful to the study of CAT as a framework for cognition-culture interactions:
I further introduce works in psycholinguistics relevant to the study of quotes online in @sec:brainscopypaste, and @sec:discussion will return to how future works could make deeper use of "Smartphone Psychology" to contribute to the more contentious issues.
\todo{actually do that.}
Let me now move on to the most debated developments of cultural evolution, the criticisms opposed to the approach, the alternatives emerging from these critiques, and the possibilities of reconciliation.
