# Introduction

## Outline

People attempt to unify cognitive science and the social sciences under the same theoretical umbrella.
Potential umbrellas are:

* CAT
* Copy-based cultural evolution
* Ingold's developmental systems theory-based approach

Empirical approaches to test these, for now, fall into three main approaches:

* Experimental transmission chains on simple content
* Compilation of historical works or data
* Social network data analysis

Each has its problems:

* Transmission chains are on excessively simple content
* Historical compilations miss the variety of situations (lose detail), and are hard-put to distinguish explanations
* Social network analysis doesn't look at cognitive factors

I suggest that, by combining the advantages of those approaches, and using current technology:

* We can test new questions
* Questions that were theoretical or unknown emerge as unavoidable

I aim to contribute two detailed case-studies to 1) show this, 2) bring a couple new results, 3) discuss the relevance of CAT for cultural evolution.
