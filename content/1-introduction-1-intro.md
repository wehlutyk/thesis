# Introduction

Have you ever been hit by the sudden memory of a sentence you read somewhere, maybe in an article a few days back, without being able to locate exactly when or where that was?
You type what you remember of the sentence in an online search engine, but nothing comes out.
You recall the ideas that the sentence had triggered for you.
You change the wording a little, playing around with the phrasing, trying to recreate the particular rhythm and sequence of words that had led you to ideas that are still so crisp and clear in your mind.
You are positive that these particular words were used;
maybe not that one;
but this one yes.
You might even tell a friend about it, to see if it reminds her of something you could be missing.
Hours or days later, a chance encounter leads you to remember which article you read the sentence in.
You open the article, find the sentence and read it carefully, and while the idea you remembered is definitely there, it becomes clear that your own phrasing was somewhat different.
What you had typed in the search engine was missing the middle part, and one or two words were changed.
In such cases I think "No wonder I couldn't find the original article in the first place!"

In your search for the sentence you might have used half a dozen formulations of the idea you were thinking of.
The present thesis is interested in these reformulations.
What do they have in common with the original?
What are they missing, what has changed?
Do the changes have anything to do with what you were doing when you first read the sentence?
Or with what triggered the memory of the sentence?
How would such changes accumulate if you were to tell your own phrasing to someone else, to be later recalled?


LOCATE

Over the last 40 years the field of cognitive anthropology, along with the approach to cultural evolution it suggests, has emerged as the strongest view of how science could combine the findings of anthropology, cognitive science, and biology.
This approach, now "a booming cottage industry on the borders of evolutionary biology, archaeology, and biological anthropology" [following @sterelny_cultural_2017, and the labels he suggests], has two central traditions: the Californian, initiated by parallel works of @cavalli-sforza_cultural_1981 and @boyd_culture_1985, and the Parisian, federated around the seminal work of @sperber_explaining_1996.
The two traditions agree on the combination of fields they defend.


- it has a number of variants, of which SCE and CAT, which seem to agree on the philosophical framing of things, but have open debates and differing focuses
- it also has stark critiques

- at stake in those debates is the overarching vision/paradigm of how facets fit together, which defines the set of obvious and difficult things, guides the design of new questions, experiments, and implementations.

- recently new generations have developed in several fields: cognitive science is at a crossroads, evolutionary biology also. 4E / DST / Eco-evo-devo

- the particular question here is: observe actual phenomena, explain them. From there, what are the ways of accounting for all these phenomena in a unique framework, i.e. with a small number of guiding principles, that will give intelligibility at high level, and guide further questions. What are the differences between the various approaches, and which approaches are viable. Oyama 2001: "We believe that the heuristic value of the idea of developmental information in certain contexts is more than outweighed by its misleading connotations". (This problem, the cog-soc link, is also sometimes viewed as the question of what human nature is, because an answer to that question would define the unit of analysis for culture and everything else.)

- How could there be any problems, and how is this a real question, since it's all a matter of empiricism? How is this a scientific question? Well it's a question at the level of scientific programmes
- First, the breadth of things you can look at is such that a theory will let you define what things are worth looking at. It also makes some cases more natural to explain than others. So a first question is, how much of the phenomena does it capture easily.
- Inside those things, some phenomena are not explained and we have a good idea of what could be the explanation
- Some other phenomena are not explained, and we have no idea how to tackle them, like the hard problem of content
- And the approach you take on those unsolved problems can be somewhat foundational for the rest of your theory, and makes other phenomena more or less natural to account for
- I don't claim to help with anything in the HPC. But I do think that existing theories can be moved forward by improving current empirical methods, to try and see how they pan out in relation to these hard problems.


FOCUS

- I will focus on CAT
- CAT, or ER, was developed by Sperber in the 90's, in a series of innovative articles
- explicitly not a reductionism, and not a Grand Unified Theory
- he proposes a general ontology where we think of things as representations, public/private that circulate, and that global dynamical system has attractors (that are more or less contingent on a situation in space and time)
- that lets us give an ontology for a framework, where we can rephrase long-standing anthropological questions in terms of spread of representations
- the hypothesis of attractors is the main added value of the theory: it claims that because of the interaction of biology, cognition, environment, and current cultural state, the space of how things evolve is somewhat skewed

- as can be understood by the recent name change, it's not clear that representations are the focus (e.g. distance when talking, or even the ClaidiÃ¨re & Sperber 2007 example of smoking). I believe the central intuition was that psychology, in the form of at-the-time-emerging cognitive science, has a rich part to play in any synthesis, and is a core ingredient in the appearance of attractors.
- indeed, that is what is emphasised in debates with SCE
- also, it is not an explanatory theory in the sense of quantum physics (as it's not a GUT): Sperber reminds us that finding an attractor is only a cue to looking for its underlying causes. Instead it's a way of thinking at a high level, like a philosophy maybe
- so in a way, it can't be proved or disproved. But it can be more or less fruitful in generating situations and ideas, and providing a global assembly of facts


ARGUE/EXPAND

- up to now, empirical approaches fall into three categories: experimental transmission chains on simple content, compilation of historical works or data, social network data analysis
- each has its problems: transmission chains are on excessively simple content, historical compilations miss the variety of situations (lose detail) and are hard-put to distinguish explanations, social network analysis doesn't look at cognitive factors

- my focus will be on short utterances, bringing case studies of two types, one of each
- in-vivo, where there is huge complexity, but it's ecological
- in-vitro, where one can control the complexity a little, but you have to set a task and anything you do is subject to that choice
- I choose this for two main reasons: first, the availability of data, or relative ease in collecting it (though we'll discuss that). Second, language is at the core of the criticisms on CAT, so it's a good way to go to tease approaches apart.
- discuss the usefulness of those cases for CAT (and vice versa): does it help capture and account for the phenomena? And above all, do we observe attraction/convergence in these case studies? If not why not? Do we transform meaning in a particular fashion given a particular situation, and if such effects are observed can they be somehow generalised?
- show how developing these experiments helps:
  - (1) formulate existing questions in more detail, and possibly ask new questions: convergence becomes a concrete question with real measures in these experiments, obstacles to or inappropriateness of convergence can become evident also
  - (2) show the pain-points and problems in CAT. Notably:
    - the question of what information is, i.e. the information dualism of representations
      - -> level of description for convergence/transformation (can't decide on a principled level)
      - -> interpretation and meaning
    - taking context & environment into account, which is tackled by RT and Niche Construction, although that may not be enough, as it can maintain the dualism of nature/culture (might follow from the information dualism), even if you believe that it started early in biological evolution


OUTLINE

- I start with a detailed review of the literature on current approaches to cultural evolution, neighbouring areas, and parallels, alternatives, or downright criticisms
- I go on to detail the open problems of the field, seen both from its advocates and from its critiques
- I then explain how I contribute to those problems
- The second part details the first case study, an in-vivo "experiment" led on quotes on the internet
- The third part details the second case study, an in-vitro transmission chain experiment of short utterances of various types
- The final part revisits the contributions such experiments can bring to highlight (1) what has been unexplored, (2) the main challenge further case studies in this area are faced with and how it relates to criticisms, (3) how it would be possible to move forward.
