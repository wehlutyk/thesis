# Introduction

Have you ever been hit by the sudden memory of a sentence you read somewhere, maybe in an article a few days back, without being able to locate exactly when or where that was?
You might type what you remember of the sentence in an online search engine, but nothing comes out.
You recall the ideas that the sentence had triggered for you.
You change the wording a little, play around with the phrasing, trying to recreate the particular rhythm and sequence of words that had led you to ideas that are still so crisp and clear in your mind.
Still, the search engine doesn't find it.
You might even tell a friend about it, to see if it reminds her of something you could be missing.
Hours or days later, a chance encounter leads you to remember which article you read the sentence in.
You open the article, find the sentence and read it carefully, and while the idea you remembered is definitely there, it becomes clear that your own phrasing was somewhat different.
For instance, the middle part was missing in what you had typed in the search engine, and one or two words were changed.
No wonder the search didn't succeed!

While looking for the source of this sentence, however, you might have used half a dozen formulations of the idea you had in mind.
The present thesis is interested in these reformulations.
What do they have in common with the original?
What are they missing, what is added and what else has changed?
Do the changes have anything to do with what you were doing when you first read the sentence, or with what triggered the memory of the sentence?
How would such changes accumulate if you were to tell your own phrasing to someone else, to be later recalled?
At play in this example is a routine set of processes of everyday life:
we interpret, memorise and transform ideas that arise in the course of our interactions;
sometimes, ideas of our own are also passed on to someone else with other transformations along the way.
The aim of this thesis is to gain a little insight into the effects and the set of processes at play in the successive transformation of short utterances as they are passed on between people.
Our method is empirical and exploratory:
we study these transformations through experiments that leave open the set of possible changes, and we do so with methods that combine previously isolated approaches to the question, so as to work around the limitations of each.

The more general goal of this thesis is to contribute a detailed empirical study case to Cultural Attraction Theory (previously known as the theory of Epidemiology of Representations), a broad framework to understand the way ideas, practices, habits and techniques evolve in a community.
Since its initial introduction by @sperber_explaining_1996, this proposal has grown into one of the two main cognitively-inspired approaches to understanding the way a community's culture evolves over time due to mechanisms at the inter-individual level (the other being Standard Cultural Evolution, @cavalli-sforza_cultural_1981; @boyd_culture_1985).
These approaches, now "a booming cottage industry on the borders of evolutionary biology, archaeology, and biological anthropology" [@sterelny_cultural_2017], also propose a way of combining works from anthropology, cognitive science and evolutionary biology, disciplines that have remained isolated from one another for too long.

The cultural attraction proposal we focus on is explicitly not a reduction of one of these fields to the other.
Nor does it claim to be a grand theory unifying all the disciplines studying life under one umbrella.
Instead, Cultural Attraction Theory creates bridges between cognitive science and anthropology so that the two can eventually work together in a common formulation of their questions.
To do so it proposes a general ontology where culture is thought of as a collection of representations:
representations can be either public, for instance a picture, a public speech, or this thesis, or they can be mental, when someone interprets a public representation that they are perceiving.
The ideas I am presenting in this thesis, for instance, form mental representations in my mind.
As I write them down, they appear to you as a public representation.
If my writing is clear and accurate enough, the mental representations that you will form while reading this thesis should be relatively close to the representations I have.
In all likelihood, however, substantial change will have appeared in the process, just as in our example above.
Cultural Attraction Theory suggests that society can be modelled as a large dynamical system of representations being constantly interpreted into mental versions, and produced as new and transformed public representations.
A central question then appears:
given the significant changes that representations undergo each time they are interpreted and produced anew, how is it that culture can be so stable over time?
The cultural attraction approach answers this question by suggesting that, due to the interaction of cognitive processes and contextual factors at play when representations are transformed, the dynamical system that models a society should have attractors.
In other words, it suggests that there are regions of representation space, more or less contingent on the state of culture at a point in time, towards which representations tend to come closer when they are transformed;
these are called *cultural attractors*, and are Cultural Attraction Theory's main concept for explaining the stability of culture over time.

The hypothesis of cultural attractors is interesting in two respects.
On one side, it provides intelligibility into culture and its processes of change.
On the other side, it incorporates a central claim of the theory, namely that cognitive processes play an important role in the way culture evolves over time.
Empirically validating the existence of such attractors has thus become a major goal for the theory, but doing so has proven challenging.
Indeed, it is not easy to collect quantitative data on the evolution of representations.
Up to now, empirical approaches to the question have fallen into three broad categories, each of which has some limitations.
The first is to simulate the evolution of representations in the laboratory, using a setup known as a *transmission chain*.
This approach allows for a detailed analysis of the transformations, but is often forced to use particularly simple (and thus unecological) representations in order to make such analysis tractable.
The second is to compile historical and anthropological works on a given subject to reconstitute the evolution of a type of representation as documented.
This approach has also been successful in a number of cases, but is hard put to tease apart the possible explanations for the evolutionary trajectories it observes.
The third is to study the evolution of representations in online social networks, an approach which up to now has mostly overlooked the cognitive mechanisms at work in the process.
Our practical goal in this thesis, then, is to introduce new empirical methods which combine the strengths of existing approaches, and can contribute to the validation of cultural attractors.
We will do so by focusing on the evolution of short utterances.



ARGUE/EXPAND

- in-vivo, where there is huge complexity, but it's ecological
- in-vitro, where one can control the complexity a little, but you have to set a task and anything you do is subject to that choice
- I choose this for two main reasons: first, the availability of data, or relative ease in collecting it (though we'll discuss that). Second, language is at the core of the criticisms on CAT, so it's a good way to go to tease approaches apart.
- discuss the usefulness of those cases for CAT (and vice versa): does it help capture and account for the phenomena? And above all, do we observe attraction/convergence in these case studies? If not why not? Do we transform meaning in a particular fashion given a particular situation, and if such effects are observed can they be somehow generalised?
- show how developing these experiments helps:
  - (1) formulate existing questions in more detail, and possibly ask new questions: convergence becomes a concrete question with real measures in these experiments, obstacles to or inappropriateness of convergence can become evident also
  - (2) show the pain-points and problems in CAT. Notably:
    - the question of what information is, i.e. the information dualism of representations
      - -> level of description for convergence/transformation (can't decide on a principled level)
      - -> interpretation and meaning
    - taking context & environment into account, which is tackled by RT and Niche Construction, although that may not be enough, as it can maintain the dualism of nature/culture (might follow from the information dualism), even if you believe that it started early in biological evolution


OUTLINE

- I start with a detailed review of the literature on current approaches to cultural evolution, neighbouring areas, and parallels, alternatives, or downright criticisms
- I go on to detail the open problems of the field, seen both from its advocates and from its critiques
- I then explain how I contribute to those problems
- The second part details the first case study, an in-vivo "experiment" led on quotes on the internet
- The third part details the second case study, an in-vitro transmission chain experiment of short utterances of various types
- The final part revisits the contributions such experiments can bring to highlight (1) what has been unexplored, (2) the main challenge further case studies in this area are faced with and how it relates to criticisms, (3) how it would be possible to move forward.
