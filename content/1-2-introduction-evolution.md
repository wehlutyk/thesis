## Culture, stability and change

### The notion of culture: a question and a problem

#### Stability and change

Habits, rituals, languages and ways of thinking are strikingly diverse across different regions of the globe.
When spending time in a foreign country and getting to know people who live there, we are often surprised by how different their behaviour is from our own, be it in obvious touristy attractions or in minute and unsuspected details.
People salute each other and lead mundane interactions differently;
they wash and eat with different equipment, utensils, bodily movements, and at different rhythms and moments of the day.
If one understands the language, it is often clear that people in a foreign country also *think* differently:
ideas that we feel are deeply counter-intuitive are obvious to them and need not be said;
other things we might spontaneously say will outrage them;
misunderstandings are widespread.
The differences are such that we are easily tired, and after a while we become uncomfortable in daily interactions, without noticing exactly why.
One need not travel to distant countries to experience such changes:
being immersed in an unfamiliar social circle at home can be enough.
This set of artefacts, practices, bodily and thinking habits, which can be so varied from one community to another, is what we commonly call a culture.
Culture is a fuzzy notion of course, but an important one, since we use it to label the aspects of life that vary most, or that vary the fastest, across human and animal communities, and to set them aside from those that vary less or more slowly (for instance, the shape of the body).

@mauss_les_1936, for instance, set out to study the ways in which people of different communities and throughout history use their bodies differently.
He noticed and began documenting the resting postures, the attitudes, the ways of walking, of swimming, or of sleeping, that different communities adopt, pass on to their offspring, and evolve through time.
Mauss's observations of the evolution of practices bring us to the first general question raised by culture:
while it is clear that the culture of a community changes over time (notice how the past is sometimes described as just another foreign country), the way it changes is remarkably slow and gradual.
On one side, we know that a culture is transmitted in some form or other, as newer generations of a community grow into a pre-existing set of habits, practices and ideas, or as interacting people of the same generation influence each other's behaviours.
On the other side, it is not at all clear what exactly is transmitted between people, either in a given generation or from one generation to the next.
@durkheim_suicide:_2012, for instance, started his seminal study by puzzling at the regularity of suicide rates over the years, and at the correlation of these rates with social variables such as religion.
How does the stability of such phenomena come about, and what are the regularities in the changes that occur?
The relative stability of cultures is all the more surprising given that, in everyday life, few activities seem to be actively transmitting anything at all.
Of course we sometimes imitate behaviours that we observe in someone else, and many education-related activities explicitly aim to transmit a particular skill or body of knowledge (though hardly anything explicitly related to suicide).
But most routine interactions are not concerned with the conservation or transmission of anything, and it seems that aspects of a culture can be stable without ever being explicitly taught.
Defining what culture is, then, immediately poses the question of what mechanisms underlie its transmission and gradual change.


#### Interaction of cultural and non-cultural aspects

Mauss also asked what part psychological mechanisms play in the development of cultural practices, and what influence such practices have in turn on psychological mechanisms.
This brings us to the second matter that arises when attempting to separate what is cultural from what is not:
how does each aspect influence the other?
In particular, if cultural and non-cultural aspects have different transmission mechanisms, how do they interact with each other?

Mauss saw that cultural practices are intimately linked to the physiology of bodies, on one side, and to a community's history on the other, but also to inherited psychological mechanisms;
indeed, he considered cultural practices to be complete *physio-psycho-sociological* phenomena.
Durkheim on the other hand gave more autonomy to sociological facts.
He argued for instance that suicide, because of its continuity over time and its dependency on social variables, should be viewed as a *social fact*:
a phenomenon which, in spite of manifesting itself individually, has emerging properties in large groups, with a causal life at the level of other emergent social phenomena and causal effects on the psychological mechanisms of the members of a community.
Mauss proposed a somewhat different focus.
For him, cultural practices are embodied properties of organisms, incorporated through the everyday actions of a community, into which children grow by imitation, teaching, or other kinds of learning.
Because of this embodied nature of cultural practices, he argued, bodily capacities cannot be defined without referring to culture.
Walking, for instance, becomes difficult to define in a standard or general way:
there is no normal way of walking, there are only *ways* of walking.
By living with different bodily practices, different communities develop different bodies, none of which are standard.
Indeed, most of the techniques of the body documented by Mauss play a role in the physiological and psychological development of people growing into them, with noticeable effects such as making one able to sleep while standing or horse-riding.
Thus, while Durkheim and Mauss would not necessarily agree on the causal autonomy of culture from physiology or psychological mechanisms, both agree (unsurprisingly) that there are strong interactions between cultural practices, individual physiology, and psychological mechanisms.

In our previous introduction of the question of cultural change, we used a definition of culture as those aspects of life that vary more, or faster, across (human or non-human) communities, to be contrasted with those which vary less, or more slowly.
Most definitions of culture nowadays make a stronger claim:
they consider that culture is that which is not universal in a given species, and contrast it with that which is biologically determined (or constrained) and thus common to all members of the species.
In this case, biological determination refers to the way the genome constrains the physiological and cognitive development of an organism in a normal viable environment.
Let us then call this the *culture-as-non-genetic* definition.
Since the details of such genetic determination, and more importantly its theoretical import, are contentious issues, in this thesis we will remain with a definition in terms of higher and lower variability.
However, the culture-as-non-genetic definition has the advantage of making the question of the reciprocal influence of culture and non-culture more explicit and relatable to Mauss's and Durkheim's concerns.
The question translates to, first, how body and cognition influence culture and cultural change, and second, how cultural change influences the environment and the interactions in which an organism develops, both physiologically and cognitively.
Since environmental changes can have effects on the way the body and cognitive capacities of an organism develop, such influence can create feedback loops between physiological and cognitive development, on one side, and cultural change on the other.
The problem, then, is that such feedback loops may be so intricate that it becomes difficult or impossible to differentiate what is cultural from what is not, eventually questioning the utility of a cultural versus non-cultural separation in the first place.

\bigskip

In this thesis we empirically study an application of the first question:
we ask about the details of short-term cultural change in the case of linguistic utterances, whose evolution we observe in short transmission chains online and in controlled experiments.
However, we will see that this study case is not entirely isolated from the second question:
the issue of how cognition and culture depend on each other will reappear once we turn to the role of linguistic meaning in the short-term evolution of utterances.
In the two subsections that follow ([@sec:intro-culture-evo;@sec:intro-culture-empirical]), then, we present the theoretical and empirical approaches on which our work is based.
These approaches argue that cultural and non-cultural evolution can be studied as *gene-culture co-evolution*, which separates two parallel but interacting evolutionary processes:
biological evolution based on genetic inheritance, and cultural evolution based on cultural transmission mechanisms.
They further flesh out the details of cultural evolution, thus proposing a theoretical answer to the first question.
It is this proposal which we aim to empirically assess in the case of linguistic utterances.
In the section that follows this one (@sec:intro-cogsoc), we briefly present works that qualify the conceptual distinction between cultural and non-cultural aspects of life, and suggest that instead of a co-evolution with two parallel channels, several additional channels or a continuity of channels could be necessary.
While we will not explicitly rely on these works in the following chapters, the debate they are part of is a useful piece of context for the final discussion of our results.


### Cultural evolution {#sec:intro-culture-evo}

Today's study of cultural stability and change is heavily influenced by proponents from cognitive science and biology.
Inspired by the generality of the populational approach underlying contemporary evolutionary theory, a wave of theories of cultural stability and change developed throughout the eighties and nineties by adopting the culture-as-non-genetic definition and proposing a blend of three fundamental components to study it:

(a) Standard evolutionary theory to describe the evolution of gene frequencies (i.e., non-cultural evolution),
(b) Insights that the application of generalised evolutionary principles may, or may not, bring to the study of cultural stability and change,
(c) A construal of the two processes of change, genetic and cultural, as parallel evolutions that actively interact, notably through cognitive mechanisms, learning, and environmental engineering.

The combination of (a) and (b) is not new, as a similar inspiration underlay the development of memetics [@dawkins_selfish_2006].
\(b) can be fleshed out in different manners however.
Memetics, for instance, suggested that the full details of the neo-Darwinian synthesis could be applied to culture:
it considered culture as a collection of particles (memes, the cultural counterpart of genes) that are transmitted from person to person with random variation, and differentially reproduced because of their competition for attention.
The new wave, which we will call *cultural evolutionist*, is not committed to such a genetic view of culture:
for these approaches culture need not be particulate, and the way cultural things change when they are transmitted or learned is by no means random.
Mostly, cultural evolutionists suggest that it can be useful to study how much cultural change differs from or is similar to genetic change, and then to apply only the analytical tools which remain valid in light of that comparison (if any).
Tim Lewens clarifies the position of this new wave regarding previous evolutionary approaches to culture:

> "Cultural evolutionists frequently begin their theorizing from a starting point that does not invite use of the meme concept, and may therefore appear neutral regarding its propriety. Their project is to integrate various forms of learning into evolutionary theory, in a way that leaves open the degree to which learning has anything in common with genetic inheritance."
> [@lewens_cultural_2012, p. 466]

Finally, the addition of (c) is another important difference between the new wave and previous Darwinian approaches to culture:
not only can general evolutionary principles be useful to the study of culture itself, but culture and genes can also be seen as bearers of two different types of information, transmitted across generations through two parallel channels.
The way changes occur in each transmission channel leads to evolution of genes and culture at different time scales;
furthermore, since culture can have an effect on the environment in which genetic mutations are selected for, and since genes constrain the organisms that bear and transmit culture, the two evolutionary processes interact and become co-evolutionary.
The way genetic and cultural evolutionary processes interact has been studied in two parallel approaches, which @sterelny_cultural_2017 terms the Californian and the Parisian traditions.


#### Californian

@cavalli-sforza_cultural_1981 were the first to provide a detailed articulation of these three components:
evolutionary theory, evolutionary principles applied to culture, and the co-evolution of the two.
They did so by building on the fact that an evolutionary process need not be mediated by genetic transmission to take place.
Indeed, as @lewontin_cultural_1982 synthesises, evolution can happen whenever a population of items has the following three characteristics:

- There exists a transmission process by which a new item correlates to the initial item it was created from (e.g. the phenotype of an offspring depends on the phenotype of the parent)
- There is variation in the properties of items in the population,
- Items survive and spread differentially depending on these varying properties.

By looking at genetic models of evolution as a special case of these general principles of evolution, @cavalli-sforza_cultural_1981 developed the mathematical analysis of purely phenotypic transmission, which can take different paths in a given population:
vertical (from parent to offspring), oblique (from a non-parent member of the previous generation to a member of the next generation), horizontal (inside one generation), or any combination thereof.
@boyd_culture_1985 [-@boyd_origin_2005] further developed this line, leading to the formulation of *Standard Cultural Evolution* (hereafter SCE) which offers a systematic analysis of part of the interactions between cultural and genetic evolution.
This approach is now vibrant with empirical work [see @acerbi_if_2015 for a review of recent studies].

A notable feature of this programme is that it does not constrain itself into a particular view of culture.
While the main authors define culture as "information that people acquire from others by teaching, imitation, and other forms of social learning" [@boyd_origin_2005, p. 3], the mathematical models they develop can be used without giving too much conceptual strength to the notion of cultural information itself (which is difficult to define).
Indeed, their results are based on the correlation of behaviours because *something* is transmitted across individuals in a community, not on an ontological claim about the nature of what exactly is being transmitted.
The approach also has strong links to works that qualify the conceptual distinction between non-genetic and genetic aspects of life (in particular through the analysis of niche construction, to which we come back later on).
It is thus a central theory for the study of how cultural and non-cultural aspects of life interact.
In this thesis, however, we will mostly focus on the Parisian approach to cultural evolution, which we can now present in more detail.


#### Parisian {#sec:intro-review-parisian}

In the mid-nineties Dan Sperber formalised a second influential approach to the question of cultural stability and change:
in a series of innovative articles gathered in @sperber_explaining_1996, the author puts forward a research programme called *Epidemiology of Representations* (better known today as *Cultural Attraction Theory*, i.e. CAT), and seeks to provide the cognitive and social sciences with a common framework with which to address interdisciplinary matters such as cultural evolution.
One of the guiding questions of Sperber's work is the following:
how can we explain the relative stability of cultures through time despite the fact that most interactions between human beings seem to be transmitting very little (if anything at all) about a community's culture?
In developing an answer, Sperber commits himself to presenting a coherent ontology to define culture and identify exactly what is transmitted in human interactions, while at the same time connecting with the many ontologies he identifies in anthropology.

Sperber suggests that culture can be defined with a simple ontology made of *representations*.
Representations can be *mental*, as defined and studied by cognitive science, or can be expressed as *public* representations in diverse cultural artefacts such as pieces of text, utterances, pictures, myths, built structures, et caetera.
New mental representations are constantly formed in people's minds whenever they perceive or interpret public representations.
For instance, say I am thinking of a tune (mental representation), and I whistle it (public representation);
someone else hears it, and forms their own mental representation.
Most of the time, the new representation in that person's head is different from my original representation.^[
The recognition that representations change so much when they are transmitted through human interactions is a defining feature of the theory Sperber proposes, in contrast to memetics and to the Californian approach outlined above [@sperber_explaining_1996, pp. 25-26, 31].
]

On this basis, Sperber proposes to model human communities as large dynamical systems of people continuously interpreting public representations into mental representations, and producing new public representations through their situated actions, in which mental representations play a role.
Culture, he then suggests, can be seen as the pool of representations that circulate in a given community, and studying the stability and change of a culture amounts to describing the *epidemiology of representations* in a community.
In other words, to explain culture in this framework is to describe the processes by which representations circulate through a society, leading certain strains to spread more or less widely as they are transmitted and transformed by individual interactions.
The exact processes that lead representations to spread or change can be extremely varied, as representations themselves correspond to diverse cultural domains.
A military technique, for instance, is transmitted and transformed through different processes than the ones at work for the transmission of, say, a particular game at school.
The first involves military instruction, a hierarchy of members, explicit knowledge bases and so on, while the second involves informal imitation and daily interactions of children playing with each other during school breaks.
Still, the basic ontology remains grounded in the unique notion of mental representations from cognitive science.

By developing such an ontology to connect disciplines, Sperber proposes a credible bridge between the notions of representation in social science and that of mental representation in cognitive science, without reducing one area to the other or making simplistic assumptions about the phenomena encountered.
Using an ontologically clear notion of representation is a useful step, Sperber argues, as the notions of representation in social science are so diverse that no common definition can be agreed upon;
instead, the cognitive notion of representation can be used to unify the various notions already studied in social science [@sperber_explaining_1996, pp. 16, 24-25, 33, 61-63, 78-80].
In this sense, his proposal is that of a naturalistic ontology for the study of culture which builds on cognitive science principles, while at the same time recognising the diversity of cultural phenomena to be studied.
It is thus amenable to anthropology, and encourages the combination of the two bodies of knowledge with clear definitions.
Sperber can then rephrase interdisciplinary questions in terms of spread and transformation of representations.
In particular, the question of how culture remains relatively stable through time can be reformulated as follows:
Why do some representations spread much more than others in a given community, remaining stable at the population level in spite of being repeatedly transformed by individual interactions?
Such representations, called *cultural representations*, can be taken to characterise the culture of a given community (for instance clothing habits, eating customs or values, or technological knowledge).
Thus, in the epidemiological framework proposed by Sperber, the question of cultural stability and change is the question of the stability of cultural representations at the population level.

To answer this question, Sperber introduces an additional concept:
the dynamical system of representations which models a community's culture exhibits attractors, called *cultural attractors*, that depend on the complex interaction of psychological and ecological factors in the transmission of representations, and on the distribution of representations at a given moment in time [@sperber_explaining_1996, pp. 106-118].
A cultural attractor is thus a region in representation space towards which representations tend to come closer whenever they are transformed in an interaction.
Such attraction can be due to a variety of factors.
The tale of Little Red Riding Hood, for instance, could have remained stable through time because of an attractor due to basic cognitive mechanisms favouring a particular structure in the story.
The recipe for Mornay sauce could be stable through time because of constraints on the way it is taught, and the physical possibilities to realise the mixture of ingredients.
To take yet another example, the practice of smoking can be seen as a range of public representations with two attractors:
either not smoking at all, or developing an addiction and behavioural habits for smoking around 25 cigarettes a day [@claidiere_role_2007].
Note that the distribution of representations in a community depends not only on attractors, but also on where new representations come from and where they disappear.
In the case of smoking, one can imagine a constant flow of people starting to smoke about 10 cigarettes a day, and gradually being attracted to 0 or 25 a day, such that the steady-state distribution of smoking behaviours is rather flat from 0 to 25 cigarettes a day [@claidiere_role_2007].
Cultural attractors are one of the core concepts of CAT, as they provide intelligibility for the evolution of culture and for the reciprocal influence of psychology, culture, and environment.
As such, a central goal in the CAT research stream has been to identify existing attractors, and explain their emergence based on the interaction of psychological and ecological factors.

The most important intuition in Sperber's proposal, and what differentiates it from previous works, is the centrality of individual psychology for the evolution of culture and its role in the emergence of attractors [@sperber_explaining_1996, p. 31].
He substantiates this by relying heavily on contemporary cognitive science, and in particular by adopting and extending the view of the modularity of mind initially defended by @fodor_modularity_1983 (his view goes further than Fodor's, as he argues for a *massive modularity of mind* applying not only to perception but also to conceptual processes).
Combining this view with epidemiology of representations, Sperber argues, results in a theory that avoids two common pitfalls.
On one side, too abstract approaches tend to consider that culture can be completely studied without going into the details of individual cognitive processes;
this stance has obvious problems with known constraints about the way our cognitive system works, and with our own intuition of how easy or difficult it is to learn certain practices or certain ideas [@sperber_explaining_1996, pp. 63-66].
Taking into account the role of psychological constraints is also not incompatible with an account of the diversity of cultures as observed in ethnography [@sperber_explaining_1996, chapter 6].
On the other side, naive applications of neo-darwinist formalism to the specific case of culture (such as memetics) lead to a grotesque simplification of culture itself, and of the role of cognitive processes in cultural evolution [@sperber_explaining_1996, p. 101].
The importance that CAT gives to individual psychology is often highlighted as one of the main differences with SCE [@sterelny_cultural_2017, p. 47].
Indeed, the main question for SCE is how organisms select the sources from which they copy cultural traits, as in that framework such choices can have large effects on the overall cultural evolution (for instance selecting for prestige, conforming to majority choices, etc.).
For CAT, instead, the main question is how the interaction of psychological and ecological factors leads to cultural attractors, an interaction that can explain the overall stability of some representations in the face of important micro-level transformations.
CAT is nonetheless compatible with the framework of gene-culture co-evolution developed by SCE;
in fact, the two theories seem to be converging towards common accounts lately, and most authors consider that the two focus on slightly different but complementary questions [@sperber_explaining_1996, p. 114;@acerbi_if_2015;@sterelny_cultural_2017].

The space opened by the development of SCE and CAT has generated much debate [see e.g. the peer commentary to @mesoudi_towards_2006] and some heated criticisms [@ingold_trouble_2007; answered in @mesoudi_science_2007; @lewens_cultural_2012, pp. 461-2 provides further discussion and context], especially concerning the way these theories model the interaction of cultural and non-cultural aspects of life.
We will come back to these debates in @sec:intro-cogsoc.
For now, let us turn to the empirical validation of CAT.

<!-- comes back to these debates and criticisms, which we group into two broad categories.
The first concerns the specifics of the evolutionary approach adopted by SCE and CAT:
what evolutionary mechanisms should they take into account (for instance niche construction, or epigenetic or extended inheritance) and, correspondingly, how long the restriction of inheritance to two isolated and parallel channels will remain the best approximation.
The second critique concerns what @thompson_mind_2007 has termed the "informational dualism" of the notion of representation in cognitive science:
at the concrete level, it questions whether a representationalist approach can naturalise meaning, a core aspect in the analysis of culture and life;
at the programmatic level it suggests that, compared to the focus on dynamic couplings that Thompson and his colleagues develop under the "enactive approach" banner, a focus on representations in cognitive science has less heuristic value in guiding the exploration of the interactions between culture and psychology.
Regardless of whether proponents can reconcile SCE and CAT with the second critique, I believe both approaches can benefit greatly from these debates, and that empirical study has a crucial role to play in exploring the implications of each side.
-->


#### Empirical exploration of the Parisian approach

The empirical exploration of CAT has proven a difficult task, for two main reasons.
First, Sperber clarifies that CAT is not, and should not be, a "grand unitary theory":

> "An epidemiological approach ... should not hope for one grand unitary theory. It should, rather, try to provide interesting questions and useful conceptual tools, and to develop the different models needed to explain the existence and fate of the various families of cultural representations." [@sperber_explaining_1996, p. 83]

Indeed, CAT accomplishes this:

> "What the epidemiological analogy suggests is a general approach, types of questions to ask, ways of constructing concepts, and a plurality of not too grand theoretical aims." [@sperber_explaining_1996, p. 61]

As a consequence, testing CAT means evaluating the fruitfulness of its paradigm.
No single study, or collection of studies for that matter, will reach a yes or no answer to the validity of CAT.
Still, we can reach a collective consensus about the usefulness of approaching the psychology-culture link with the tools and questions developed by that theory.

As the name Cultural Attraction Theory indicates, an important part of that toolbox is the notion of cultural attractor, which can be empirically studied:
the presence or absence of a well-defined attractor in a given situation can be turned into a testable hypothesis.
One can also evaluate, at the meta-analytical level, if tackling a problem with a cultural attraction approach generates productive questions and fruitful studies, or if it is more of a hindrance in explaining the phenomena at hand.
In short, while testing CAT empirically is not a simple matter of yes or no, the theory provides a clear set of tools and lines of thought that are well worth evaluating in a wider, programmatic appraisal.

The second challenge to empirical exploration resides in the fact that quantitative data on out-of-laboratory cultural artefacts is not easy to collect.
Although theoretical models to guide that exploration are gradually appearing [@claidiere_role_2007; @claidiere_how_2014], developing methods for the quantitative study of attractors is still an open problem.
The literature on CAT shows at least two important methods that have been used up to now.
First, the meta-analysis of large numbers of anthropological or historical works, which has uncovered several relevant effects.
The way portraits were painted in Europe over the centuries, for instance, has been shown to increasingly favour direct- versus oblique-gaze portraying [@morin_how_2013].
In CAT terms, existing paintings are a collection of public representations from which younger painters learn and are inspired, creating their own mental representations of the paintings.
A cultural attraction towards direct-gaze portraits (whose exact roots could be a cognitive bias, but that is not yet clear) then seems to have driven the evolution of the overall distribution of public representations painted over the centuries in Europe.
@miton_universal_2015 also used archival analysis techniques to propose an explanation for the historical stability of the practice of bloodletting, in spite of its medical ineffectiveness.
Exploiting similar records, @baumard_increased_2015 showed a link between the evolution of religious values and the affluence of societies in which they develop.
Here again, the practice corresponding to a particular religious value (e.g. asceticism) would be the public representation that is interpreted and reproduced by people who practice the religion.
@baumard_increased_2015 hypothesise that the increased affluence that various societies experienced in the first millennium B.C. could have led to a change of life strategies (being more cooperative, investing more in the self), which in turn created a bias in the way religions are transmitted, leading religions to evolve from ritual practices into moralising practices.
In CAT terms, a change in ecological conditions would have created a transmission bias to attract religions towards more moralising values.

A second approach is to reproduce the evolution of content with human or animal participants in the laboratory, where subjects repeatedly transmit or interact around pieces of content initially chosen by the experimenters.
The resulting data is an approximation of the rapid evolution of artefacts in real life, yet in a controlled situation that can then be statistically analysed with access to all the parameters.
This technique has been used in studies ranging from the evolution of visual patterns transmitted in a group of apes [@claidiere_cultural_2014], to the role of argumentation in the transmission of solutions to simple but counter-intuitive reasoning problems [@claidiere_argumentation_2017].
The structure of the technique is straightforward:
pick a type of public representation, simulate the way it is transmitted in a community with given contextual constraints, and study the way it evolves in order to identify possible attraction patterns (due to ecological and psychological factors).
Naturally, such a setup is not exclusive to proponents of CAT, and is quite common in the study of cultural evolution in general.
Other methods for studying cultural evolution have also been developed by a number of adjacent disciplines, and we review these in the next subsection (@sec:intro-culture-empirical).

\bigskip

Let us close this presentation of theories by explaining why we chose to focus our work on CAT and not on SCE.
While the prevalence of the cultural attraction approach in the French academic landscape certainly had an impact on our choice, three better arguments can justify a deeper focus on CAT.
First, it puts cognitive science squarely in the middle of the problem, by acknowledging the importance of psychological processes in the study of culture [@scott-phillips_simple_2017].
Second, its initial goal is not so much to develop a mathematical theory of culture (which will surely flourish in due time), but to interest all disciplines studying human life in a common framework by using *principled philosophical arguments*.
Third, this approach in turn leads to a clear articulation of the philosophical principles defended, discussed, and tested by the theory at the cultural and cognitive levels.^[
In the words of Tim Ingold, an outspoken critic of both CAT and SCE: "[Sperber's work] has the virtue of rendering unusually explicit the assumptions built into much contemporary theorising about culture and cognition, and of driving them through to their logical conclusions" [@ingold_transmission_2001, p. 113].
]
As such, it seems that CAT is in a good position to generate productive debate between alternative approaches (such as propositions coming from social anthropology or other branches of cognitive science) which, at the moment, are still competing on the principled level.
Recall however that CAT and SCE have no core incompatibility, as both can be applied to analyse different facets and different scales of the same situation [@acerbi_if_2015; @sterelny_cultural_2017].
A growing number of social scientists is also discussing both approaches positively [see the comments to @mesoudi_towards_2006; and @slingerland_what_2008], and a convergence between the two is likely to occur in the near future.
Therefore, the challenges that arise when attempting to study CAT experimentally, as will be the case here for linguistic utterances, should prove helpful in developing a path to the resolution of the critiques faced by both CAT and SCE.


### Empirical work {#sec:intro-culture-empirical}

CAT has been empirically applied in a number of areas, such as the evolution of morality [@baumard_mutualistic_2013], religion [@boyer_religion_2001], or reasoning [@claidiere_argumentation_2017;@mercier_why_2011].
Two other fields will prove particularly relevant to the empirical exploration of CAT for linguistic material:
the study of the evolution of language in the laboratory, and the analysis of online content through digital media.
Indeed, both have already explored factors of linguistic evolution in a variety of situations, as well as conditions under which gradual changes can accumulate and have long term effects.
An essential tool in all these studies is the serial reproduction paradigm, which has been used extensively along with its derivatives, better known today as transmission chains and micro-societies.
Let us now present these works.
We begin with a discussion of the serial reproduction paradigm and its current applications, then move on to the field of language evolution, and finally present relevant works in the study of digital media.


#### The versatile serial reproduction paradigm

The serial reproduction paradigm was first applied in a series of influential studies on memorisation and recall by @bartlett_remembering:_1995, who was experimenting with ways of reproducing the evolution of content through iterated production and transmission across different people, under somewhat more controlled conditions than what can be achieved in field work.
The paradigm was only one among several other techniques introduced by Bartlett, but it came to have a lasting impact on later studies linking memory to culture.
Similar to a game of Chinese Whispers, people participate in a chain along which content is transmitted;
the experimenter gives a first participant initial material, typically a picture or a short piece of text, with instructions to read or memorise it;
that participant is later asked to recall or reproduce the material, and the experimenter uses their output as input for the next participant, thus constructing a chain of successive memorisation (or perception) and recollection (or reproduction) of the initial material.
Participants may or may not know that they are part of a chain.
The setup approximates the transmission and change process that happens in everyday life.
While it is quite idealised and imperfect, it allows experimenters to study the effects of different factors on the evolution of artefacts, taken as a trace of the overall process at work.

Important independent variables that may vary include the chain structure (e.g. the number and sources of preceding recollections a participant is exposed to), the reading or memorising instructions and context, the interval between exposition and recall, the possible task given during that interval (or, conversely, a possible overlap of exposition and recall, turning the task into copying, or online interaction between participants), the recall instructions and context, the ordering and organisation of participants in the chain, or the ordering of the content itself in the chain (e.g. whether a given participant is exposed to material from a single generation all in one go, or exposed instead to material successively sampled from random generations).
Typical studies will then analyse the trends in the transformation of artefacts that were produced, possibly comparing the behaviour across different chains.
When faced with the complexities of quantitatively analysing the content itself, studies often opt to contrast a simpler measure (such as rate of change) across two different populations, two conditions in the independent variables mentioned above, or two minimally different types of content.
In CAT parlance, this method corresponds to the simplest instantiation of the causal chains of public representation to mental representation to public representation (and so on) described by @sperber_explaining_1996 [p. 99], and has thus garnered much attention in the literature related to cultural attraction.

Early work contemporary to Bartlett's applied the technique in a variety of settings.
A first stream of research explored ways in which verbal memory and social or cultural background can interact.
The way short stories are conserved and transformed was shown to depend on variables such as daily activity, diversity of social backgrounds in a group, social status and age [@northway_influence_1936;@maxwell_remembering_1936].
Later works confirmed other aspects of Bartlett's intuitions, for instance the role of identifiable details in the evolution of pictures [@ward_experiment_1949], or the influence of titles on the way content is interpreted and transformed [@hall_effect_1950].^[
In a note that is quite relevant for today's situation, Hall notes that "the function of the headline or title to some story or article is that of giving a particular emphasis to certain aspects of the text, and is one of the main methods of distorting and biasing what is remembered" [@hall_effect_1950, p. 120].
He later reflects on the fact that such results have crucial political implications given the development of mass media.
]

More recently however, the reliability of Bartlett's studies has been discussed and the focus has shifted towards increased control over the experimental conditions:
@gauld_experiments_1967, while still praising Bartlett for the progress that his work represented compared to that of his predecessors, showed that changing the exposition instructions, for instance by giving strict memorisation instructions or adding a simple sentence asking participants to be "accurate", would considerably reduce the transformation rate in the resulting chains, thus questioning the effects measured by a setup without explicit memorisation instructions.
The authors open the question of the level of conscientiousness of participants in accomplishing their task, and suggest that overall transformation rates could be reduced by encouraging participants to be more careful.
Today, a few studies overcome the problem by designing experiments with an intrinsic motivation for participants to adopt the behaviour under study [e.g. @claidiere_argumentation_2017], yet the practice is still quite rare.

One recurrent problem, found across most of the above studies, is the difficulty of quantitatively analysing meaning in the material transmitted along chains.
@northway_influence_1936, through her focus on meaningfulness, @hall_effect_1950 [p. 120] and @gauld_experiments_1967 [p. 42] all indicate that analysing content itself is a laudable yet unreachable goal.
In facing that difficulty, studies recur to analyses of form, survival, or other measurable aspects of the participants' productions.
For linguistic material for instance:
the length of a recollection, the number of words, concepts, or propositions accurately recalled, or a contrast of the concepts conserved at the end of the chains.
Today the problem remains, and contemporary studies of meaningful material use the same techniques to index or approximate changes in the content of artefacts produced (indeed, the work presented in this thesis will be no exception).
While much progress can be made by using these approaches to quantifying aspects of the material, or by instead focusing on artefacts that bear no content, it seems that a consensual account of meaning and a corresponding means of analysis will be necessary for a fully-fledged theory of cultural change to establish itself.


#### Contemporary revival

Owing to the development of SCE and CAT, the last two decades have seen a renewed interest for the serial reproduction paradigm (now known as a transmission chain) and its derivatives (generally known as cultural transmission experiments), resulting in a multiplication of case studies.
Recent works have catalogued a number of high-level effects such as the stereotypification and personification of content [@bangerter_transformation_2000], the loss of details and clustering of events [@mesoudi_hierarchical_2004], the differential transformation of content depending on counter-intuitiveness [@barrett_spreading_2001;@norenzayan_memory_2006], on its consistency with gender stereotypes [@kashima_maintaining_2000], or on the amount of social information that it features [@mesoudi_bias_2006].
The hypothesis here is that the cognitive processes involved in interpretation, memorisation and recall, will influence the transformation of content in ways that might not be observable in the individual transmission step, but will be observable in the outcome of transmission chains where changes have gradually accumulated.
The evolution of content is thus often related to hypothesised cognitive biases such as hierarchicalization [@mesoudi_hierarchical_2004], negativity [@bebbington_sky_2017], or the favouring of survival or social information [@mesoudi_bias_2006;@stubbersfield_serial_2015].
However, the aims of such a catalogue of effects and the methods used to establish it have spurred some criticism [e.g. @gibbs_jr._adaptive_2010], and an approach that can separate a cognitive bias from confounding factors at the linguistic or interactive level has yet to be proposed.

A more recent stream of research explicitly focuses on the individual transmission step in a chain.
One set of works here aims to separate the transmission step into different phases such as choose-to-receive, encode-and-retrieve, and choose-to-transmit.
Each phase plays a different role in the selection and transformation of what is transmitted, and is more or less important depending on the situation.
For instance, the choose-to-transmit phase could be important in the transmission of emotional aspects of stories, because of a willingness to transmit more disgusting elements [@eriksson_corpses_2014];
the encode-and-retrieve phase is likely to be less important with digital media, as users have the possibility of directly copy-pasting content [@acerbi_cultural_2016].
Redundancy and error-correction in the receiving phase have also been shown to have an effect on transformation rates [@eriksson_advantage_2012;@acerbi_role_2016].
A second set of works has explored more free-form interaction setups, making experiments both more ecological and more sensitive to interactive and contextual factors.
For instance, unconstrained conversations have been used to study the transmission of the perception of risk in news stories [@moussaid_amplification_2015], and more thorough observational phases have been used in the evolution of building techniques [@caldwell_experimental_2008;-@caldwell_studying_2008].
A crucial point in such free-form setups is that, compared to more constrained tasks such as read-and-rewrite, much more context is available to participants to understand the content at stake [@sterelny_cultural_2017, n. 12].

The reviews provided by @mesoudi_multiple_2008 and @whiten_cultural_2016 give a broader idea of the effects studied and methods used in contemporary works using transmission chains.
@kashima_recovering_2000 also offers an interesting reappraisal of the social aspect of Bartlett's contributions, which contrasts with the way they are used today.
Indeed, Kashima argues that while Bartlett's legacy is mostly seen in psychological studies that adopt methodological individualism, Bartlett fiercely opposed that approach.
Current uses of the serial reproduction paradigm mostly serve as toy models for a view of culture and its evolution in terms of cognitively- and ultimately biologically-determined transmission biases interacting with a given context.
However, Bartlett's view was that culture is not only the aggregation of individual-level properties, but that it also has behaviours at its own level that act upon and dynamically interact with individual-level psychology in significant ways.
In particular, he believed that an explanation of culture could not be couched in terms of individual processes only, and that a dynamical explanation involving individual, interactive and social levels would be necessary instead.
This view has much in common with the preoccupations of Mauss and Durkheim (referred to in the previous subsection) who wondered about the ways in which individual psychology is also social and cultural, and asked how the co-construction of cultural and psychological processes could best be described.
Most of these questions are obviated in current uses of Bartlett's initial ideas.
One exception here is @mcgraw_cultures_2014 who, in their study of a cooperative Lego construction task, rely on the dynamical approaches to social psychology to recognise that phenomena at the level of the interaction can be causal factors in individual behaviours.

We will come back to the relevance of such dynamical approaches for the study of cultural change in the next section, but for now let us close this discussion of transmission chains by noting that there is still much room for exploration.
On one side, the methodological choices in transmission chain experiments have not yet been mapped out, and on the other, such experiments and the effects they elicit can still be framed in radically different theoretical backgrounds.
They have therefore much to bring to underlying theoretical debates.


#### Language change: Experimental semiotics and Iterated learning

A particularly interesting case of cultural stability and change is the emergence and evolution of language.
Here, the systemic aspect of language makes standard transmission chains less useful, and the question is currently studied by another portion of the community (though convergences are appearing).
While the experimental methods here are different, they share with the works above a general approach of reproducing aspects of an evolutionary process by using simplified situations in the laboratory.

A first central paradigm is that of iterated learning, which resembles a transmission chain for artificial languages where participants learn a communication system at each step [@smith_iterated_2003]:
a first group of participants must learn to use a simple artificial language (e.g. a random vocabulary for naming a range of objects), after which a second group of participants must learn that language through interaction with or transmission from the first group.
The process is then iterated over successive generations, and as the constraints on learning and transmission accumulate the artificial language gradually evolves into a more structured system.
A second setup is used in experimental semiotics, which studies the emergence of a communication system in interactive tasks with no pre-existing communication conventions [@galantucci_experimental_2009].
The setup consists in pairing participants and assigning them a task that they must cooperatively solve over repeated iterations, without changing partners.
Most often, participants can use a communication channel (or must create it) to help in coordination, such that the setup exposes the way participants iteratively develop conventions over the channel.

A major goal in this stream is to provide a non-nativist account of the emergence and structure of communication systems [@kirby_innateness_2007].
Communication systems have been shown to emerge in repeated cooperative tasks with no dedicated communication channel available [@scott-phillips_signalling_2009], or with communication channels that scramble any attempts to use normal language or known signs [@galantucci_experimental_2005].
The system that a pair of participants develops in such a task is highly dependent on the history of their interactions and on the concrete situation at hand;
these provide a shared common ground on which a pair of participants can rely, whether or not they have already found a way to solve the cooperative task itself.
Participants thus bootstrap their communication on common history and eventually develop dynamic and situated coordination patterns akin to a dialogue.

When repeatedly used in the interaction of a pair, communication systems also evolve symbolisation through an interactive grounding process [@garrod_foundations_2007].
Pair-specific communication systems will gradually align themselves into a global system when switching pairs in a community of participants [@fay_interactive_2010], and symbols will additionally lose iconicity when participants of a community are progressively replaced and the system has to be learned by newcomers [@caldwell_cultural_2012].
Note that to ensure the emergence of a communication system, these experiments task participants with an explicitly cooperative problem, which in turn means that the emerging system still has a small degree of intentional design by the participants themselves.

Thus the *unintentional* emergence of structure is studied separately, by analysing the conditions under which structure will emerge in an existing unstructured communication system without participants being aware of it.
This is done using the iterated learning paradigm.
@kirby_cumulative_2008, for instance, ask a first participant to learn and use an initially random vocabulary of object names, and extrapolate it to unknown objects;
her production is then used as the input vocabulary set for the next participant, who must in turn learn it and extrapolate it to unknown objects, and so on and so forth.
Once a pressure for expressivity of the vocabulary is factored into the task, the vocabulary evolves a compositional structure that reflects the structure of the objects named.
Crucially, the participants are not aware of the goals of the experiment, nor that they are part of a chain:
the emergent structure in the vocabulary thus appears without intentional design.
Similar regularisation and evolution of structure have been observed in simpler memorise-and-reproduce tasks where the items to be learned do not refer to external objects [@cornish_systems_2013 with sequences of categorical items; @verhoef_emergence_2014 with acoustic signals], as well as in picture-naming [@smith_eliminating_2010] and colour-naming tasks [@xu_cultural_2013], and more recently in the naming of a more complex, continuous set of objects [@carr_cultural_2017].

In sum, the iterated learning literature shows that the combination of an expressivity pressure and a learnability pressure leads a chain of users to gradually evolve structure in an initially random vocabulary set;
learning and producing are thus two core processes by which the structure emerges [@tamariz_culture:_2015].
Two additional properties might be noted about the phenomenon.
First, the evolved structure is highly dependent on the exact learning and communication situations in which the vocabulary set is used.
In particular, if the usage situations shield the participants from certain contrasts between objects to name, the final vocabulary will be under-specified with respect to the full object space:
it will not encode the dimensions that discriminate the unobserved contrasts, instead adapting to be useful only for the contrasts that users observed [@silvey_word_2015;@winters_languages_2015].
Second, changing the combination of pressures will change the way structure evolves.
In particular, it is likely that different communication patterns at the population level, or a different fabric in the population responsible for the transmission and evolution of a language (e.g. more second-language learners, or more children learners), should lead to differences in the evolution of language structure [@kirby_compression_2015].

Large portions of the iterated learning literature draw on and contribute to a parallel theoretical track which laid down the first analytical predictions for models of Bayesian agents learning and producing languages in chains.
@griffiths_language_2007 were the first to show that the analytical structure of iterated learning with uniform Bayesian agents can correspond, depending on the way the agents produce new iterations, to well-known statistical inference methods (Gibbs sampling and a flavour of the EM algorithm).
In such a setup, iterated learning predictably converges towards distributions determined by the internal prior distributions of agents (i.e. their inference bias).
In the case of vocabulary sets used to name objects, the structure of the object space will also play a role in the final evolved language, provided it has an effect on the choice of items people actually talk about [versus, the choice of objects talked about only depends on the vocabulary itself, @perfors_language_2014].
The prediction of the final distribution of iterated learning setups has been experimentally confirmed with humans on a variety of tasks [@kalish_iterated_2007;@reali_evolution_2009], and the inference biases that a given evolutionary trajectory elicits has also been shown to correspond to known biases in category learning tasks [@griffiths_using_2008].
Applied to cultural transmission chains, these results confirm that individual cognitive biases can have significant effects on the long-term evolution of cultural items [@griffiths_theoretical_2008].

@scott-phillips_language_2010 and @tamariz_cultural_2016 provide further reviews of the iterated learning literature, and @galantucci_experimental_2012 and @roberts_investigating_2017 offer reviews of experimental semiotics.
Let me close this review by noting that there is also an increasing convergence of the communities studying cultural evolution and language evolution, and of the questions they ask.


#### Digital media

The ubiquity of digitally-mediated interactions has created an avalanche of available digital traces over the past two decades, opening both questions and possibilities for the study of cultural evolution.
On one side, digitally-mediated interactions are an object of study in their own right, as they have become embedded in everyday life in many societies, with their own practices of interaction, mediation, or transmission possibly impacting cultural evolution.
Indeed digital practices are an addition to the possible range of interaction types, and the cultural evolution framework can study it as such [@acerbi_cultural_2016].
On the other side, the commodification of storage capacities and computing power has opened avenues for the quantitative analysis of the digital traces created by these new practices, and as a consequence, for a renewed empirical study of collective behaviour.
Such analyses are also increasingly being used on digitised content from before the digital transition.
Together, these possibilities make digital media an extremely relevant object and data source for the study of cultural evolution.

A major goal in the study of digital media, common with quantitative social science, is to understand how complex patterns of collective behaviour can emerge from possibly simple principles of interaction in a population of agents.
Two landmark approaches to this question are the Threshold model introduced by @granovetter_threshold_1978 to understand the global spread of behaviours (or information) in a heterogeneous population, and the Informational Cascade model introduced by @bikhchandani_theory_1992 to understand why such mass behaviours can be brittle and sensitive to small changes in the information available.
In its simplest version, Granovetter's Threshold model defines agents as deciding whether or not to adopt a behaviour depending on the number of other agents who adopted it, with an adoption threshold specific to each agent.
For instance, people can be deciding whether or not to join a riot (Granovetter's canonical example), a decision for which different people will have different thresholds.
Some people are easy trouble-makers who can start breaking windows even if everybody else is quiet, but most people will only join a riot if already 80-90% of the population is participating in it, since being apprehended in the riot is then much less likely.
Even in this simple model, a minor change in the distribution of riot-joining thresholds can lead the collective behaviour to switch from full rioting to only one person making trouble and everybody else doing nothing.^[
In a population of 100 people, imagine a uniform distribution of thresholds going from 0 to 99:
the person with threshold 0 can start rioting spontaneously, which triggers the person with threshold 1, in turn triggering the person with threshold 2, and so on and so forth until the whole population is rioting.
Now, change the person with threshold 1 to have a threshold of 2 and the chain is broken:
the population becomes quiet, aside from the spontaneous trouble-maker whom no-one follows.
]
The formalism is directly applicable to understand the spread of information (opinions, beliefs, practices), and the distribution of thresholds then defines the way a piece of information can spread in a population.
@granovetter_threshold_1978 extends this initial model in several directions to illustrate the effects of social structure or spatial and temporal dispersion.
The role of social structure in particular has been much explored in later work by combining Granovetter's ideas with an analysis of social networks [@valente_social_1996;@abrahamson_social_1997], such that the model has become a reference to understand effects of information diffusion.

The Informational Cascade model [@bikhchandani_theory_1992] proposes a second mechanism by which a population can swing from one mass behaviour to another due to small localised changes.
The basic version of the model describes a population of agents sequentially deciding whether or not to adopt a behaviour based on information of their own, and on their observation of previous adoption.
For instance, people deciding whether or not to start smoking have access to information through reading, health warnings and tobacco advertisements, and can also observe other people's choices.
In such a situation, choices start to cascade in the population whenever one agent considers that other agents' choices provide more information than their own, even if the two contradict each other:
personal information is disregarded, and an agent's choice becomes entirely determined by the choices of previous agents, such that the population enters a dynamic similar to the one described by Granovetter.
@bikhchandani_theory_1992 show that in such a sequential choice situation cascades almost always happen, can often be wrong with respect to the value of the adopted behaviour, and are also very sensitive to new information, especially if the decisions initially building up to the cascade aggregate little information.
For instance, a government publicising new research about the effects of tobacco could in theory reverse a cascade of people choosing to start smoking (in practice, many other factors are at play in the phenomenon).
Information cascades have become an important conceptual tool to understand the diffusion of information.
Later work, for instance, has integrated its principles with the network structure of populations [@watts_simple_2002], identifying which subset of a structured population should be targeted in order to trigger cascades [@kempe_maximizing_2003;@bakshy_everyones_2011], or exploring the effect of repeated exposition to a piece of information due to circulation in the network [@de_kerchove_role_2009].

While the study of information diffusion is not new [see also @rogers_diffusion_2005], the recent rise of social media and even more so the growth in computing power to make sense of the digital traces created have boosted empirical developments and validations of earlier analytical approaches.
Computational social science and the study of complex systems have boomed over the past two decades, with a multiplication of studies of the network structure and emergent dynamics of information diffusion in blogspace [@gruhl_information_2004], email networks [@liben-nowell_tracing_2008] and social media platforms [@cha_measurement-driven_2009;@bakshy_social_2009;@onnela_spontaneous_2010].
More recently, works have modelled more complex forms of information retention and transmission, by exploring the co-evolution of network structure and information topics [@cointet_socio-semantic_2009], the role of limited attention in the constant flow of information [@weng_competition_2012;@weng_attention_2015], the differential role of repeated expositions depending on the nature of the information transmitted [@romero_differences_2011], or the role of immune agents who resist the spread of a piece of information [@ruan_kinetics_2015].

With few exceptions [e.g. @klemm_globalization_2005, who use scalar content], works studying the complex dynamics of diffusion rely on an atomistic model of information:
a piece of information is modelled as being perfectly transmitted or not at all, with no possibility for transformation or partial transmission.
Studying the transformation of content requires a reliable method to create classes of similar pieces of content, a task that has been tackled only recently for blogspace [@leskovec_meme-tracking_2009].
While the role of transformations in complex dynamics is still to be mapped out, existing works show that transformations are frequent and varied in nature, including for content that should not change such as quoted text in blogs [@simmons_memes_2011;@omodei_multi-level_2012], and can lead to epidemiological behaviours similar to the spread of diseases [@adamic_information_2016].
The range of empirical questions and the technical challenges involved are such that the focus has moved towards developing methods for the collection and study of similar data sets [e.g. @leskovec_snap_2014;@leskovec_snap:_2016].
Digitised works from before the digital transition are also being opened to such studies through the development of text reuse detection methods [@moritz_non-literal_2016].

@acerbi_cultural_2016 provides a broader overview of works that are relevant for current questions of cultural evolution.
However, it is clear from this review that an integration of cultural evolutionary questions with the digital media and complex systems literature would be very fruitful, as it provides data sets and analysis techniques which have not yet been used for CAT or SCE.
The current development towards the study of transformations in information diffusion, in particular, is a strong point of convergence between the two fields.


#### Conclusion

As we discuss in the next chapter, the development of data set collection and analysis methods can bring insight, as well as refined questions, to the study of cultural evolution.
Other parts of psychology and linguistics will also prove useful in our empirical approach:
the next chapter introduces works in psycholinguistics relevant to the study of quotes online, and @sec:discussion will return to how future works could develop novel methods to study the more contentious issues in the field.
Let us now focus on some of these issues and the context in which they arise.
