## *Notes on things to add*

*These two parapraphs come from the removed discussion of Ingold, but can introduce the chat about NCT/EES/DST/Evo-devo. Simplify them.*

Ingold argues that Cultural Attraction Theory, as well as other approaches inpired by Darwin, relies on a description of life in three broad layers:
the biological layer, which serves as the substrate for the second layer, cognitive, which itself serves as the substrate for the third layer, cultural.
Each layer identifies a conceptual domain taken to be fundamentally different from the other two.
The biological level is described by the modern synthesis of evolutionary theory, centred on genetic change, and studies the *body*.
The cognitive level is described by cognitive science using the computational metaphor, which allows for the study of *mind* without necessarily worrying about its biological manifestation.
In turn, the cultural level is described by (for instance) Cultural Attraction Theory, which studies *culture* as a distribution of representations circulating in society.
The biological and cognitive layers define constraints on the way representations evolve at the cultural level (in particular through cognitive biases), but knowledge about the cultural level is not crucial to study the essential, universal parts of the mind or the body.

Each layer thus corresponds to its own object of study, implemented by the lower layers but conceptually independent from them.
Ingold calls this assembly the *complementarity thesis*, referring to the way body, mind and culture are construed as separate and complementary parts of reality [@ingold_complementarity_1998].
The criticism he opposes to this approach can then be grouped into three essential points:
(1) Each layer of the complementarity thesis is rooted in a problematic dualism that separates form and substance.
(2) Without such dualisms, it is not possible to conceptually distinguish the three layers:
there concrete manifestations are inextricable from one another, as they appear interlocked in a single object of study:
the organism.
If it is necessary to conceptually dice reality into parts or layers, it is not clear that the separation between biology, cognition and culture is the best way of doing so.
(3) The notion of organism is itself problematic.

- the question about the genetic/non-genetic divide is precisely what is discussed by NCT/EES/DST/Evo-devo, and is also well discussed by @griffiths_genetics_2013 (read intro); we take it as an open question about how to cluster the inheritance lifecycles
- debates on the cognitive side of things are beyond the scope of this intro/review, though chapter 4 will touch on them
