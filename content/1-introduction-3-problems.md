## Open problems {#sec:intro-problems}

Moving back into the core of the cultural evolution framework put forth by Californian and Parisian cultural evolution, we can now put the focus on a number of outstanding questions for current and future research.
The following discussion far from exhausts the questions to tackle, but gives nonetheless an overview of what I consider to be the most actionable items in the field.


### Attraction versus selection

The Californian and Parisian research streams are built around two complementary processes:
attraction and selection.
Attraction is the umbrella phenomenon studied mostly under the Parisian approach, and is a central concept to explain cultural constancy and change when there is no clear copying behaviour (i.e. transmission is low-fidelity):
if we find constancy and gradual change in a given cultural domain in spite of interpretation, rich effects of psychology, cognitive biases, interaction, and no clear copying behaviour of agents, then cultural attraction is a good candidate to explain evolution in this domain.
In itself, finding a cultural attractor is not an explanation, but an indication that the transmission biases are interacting in such a way that the state of culture is maintained in spite of important changes in micro-level transmission events.
Source selection is the umbrella process studied mostly under the Californian approach, and is an explanatory factor of evolution in domains that feature copying behaviours (i.e. transmission is high-fidelity):
when agents copy traits, or attempt to copy them, with for instance conformity, prestige, or content biases, then evolution can be usefully explored by looking at the way agents select the sources from which they copy, and the differential spread that entails.
Both selection and attraction act on multiple scales, as cultural traits or elements can be copied and transformed on several dimensions that potentially interact.

As @acerbi_if_2015 note, attraction and selection are not incompatible, as both are part of the overall cultural evolution process.
Given their multi-level nature, both processes can also be part of one another;
for instance, transformation at the level of a sentence can be analysed as selection at the level of words or concepts.
@sterelny_cultural_2017 also notes that the Parisian and Californian research streams differ mostly in what they aim to explain.
For the Californians, the question is how humans managed to survive and develop successful practices in the face of an opaque environment (for instance poisonous plants that, only if processed properly, can become highly nutritive).
They explain this by appealing to cumulative cultural learning, which allows agents to learn from the practices of their preceding generation by copying and slightly modifying them in the process.
Some level of imitation of copy is crucial to this account, precisely because the opacity and the dangerousness of the environment forbids the sort of self-confident experimenting one could observe without copy.
For the Parisians, the question is why cultural traditions with no clear utilitarian value can exist, and evolve, aside from survival-related practices such as cooking techniques.
They argue that the evolution of such traditions crucially involves ostensive communication (where the recipient of the communication must recognise the intention behind the communicative act), which is fidelity-neutral but not content-neutral:
not all pieces of content are communicated equally, and successful communication only rarely entails copy.
The Parisians thus ask why, in the face of a low-fidelity process that introduces such variation at every step, some cultural elements maintain a level of constancy and keep being transmitted through time, thus becoming evolving traditions.

So the two approaches aim to explain different features of culture.
In which domain is each approach most appropriate?
Are there domains that involve both imitation and non-copying communication in important degrees?
How do the two processes interact in such cases?
These are the questions left open after recognising the complementarity of the Parisian and Californian approaches.


### Interaction of cultural and genetic evolution

- to what extent cultural evolution has driven genetic evolution (Henrich)
- how exactly does one fit the niche construction / extended mind account into CAT, and how should that be formalised. Sterelny, Fuentes, Wimsatt, see it as central, and Mesoudi et al. 2006, and Feldman, also agree, and this is a commonality with DST.


### Empirical attractors

- how does one go about finding attractors, or finding that there is no attractor (proving something doesn't exist is never a workable goal)
- develop methods to do so, aside from existing things (meta-analyses, transmission chains, social network analysis), by articulating existing fields together, pushing existing paradigms further, or creating new experimental paradigms
- flesh out predictions that are the consequence of attraction in specific domains
- explore the feedback loops of attractors: if they emerge because of context, how do they participate in that context, through relevance theory, or through cognitive niche construction
- how to define a cultural trait is not settled (acerbi_if_2015, p. 494). is it in or out of the brain, and at what level is it (acerbi_if_2015, p. 493 also show examples of different levels for which you can look at Cinderella being transformed): the correct unit of analysis could be representations/information (as acerbi_if_2015 propose), and then there's a plurality of levels for which to look at (p. 494), which is not a problem as biologists also have that with genes (!)


### Formal theory versus framework, and contrasting alternatives

- sperber argues against a GGT, and that factors are a case-by-case thing. Goes with the plurality of levels at which you analyse things.
- but (1) could there be some mapping of the possible idealised behaviours of cultural evolution under CAT, just like BRH did for SCE
- and (2) that stance kind of misses the point: what makes you look at this rather than that level?
- so, how does one formalise both representations, and the context / niche
- which leads into the next point

- for CAT, the way to take context, the effects of interaction, and meaning-to-interpreter into account is through relevance theory (read wilson_relevance_2004)
- does it solve the many levels of meaning
- does it allow for modelling, i.e. do we need to convert everything into propositions
- how does it fare against a more dynamical modelling of interactions, based on the enactive notion of meaning (arguably more basic for the moment), such as (do they?) mcgraw et al. 2014?
