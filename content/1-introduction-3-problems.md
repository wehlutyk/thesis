## Open problems {#sec:intro-problems}

Moving back into the core of the cultural evolution framework put forth by Californian and Parisian cultural evolution, we can now put the focus on a number of outstanding questions for current and future research.
The following discussion far from exhausts the questions to tackle, but gives nonetheless an overview of what I consider to be the most actionable items in the field.


### Attraction versus source selection

The Californian and Parisian research streams are built around two complementary processes:
attraction and source selection.
Attraction is the umbrella phenomenon studied mostly under the Parisian approach, and is a central concept to explain cultural constancy and change when there is no clear copying behaviour (i.e. transmission is low-fidelity):
if we find constancy and gradual change in a given cultural domain in spite of interpretation, rich effects of psychology, cognitive biases, interaction, and no clear copying behaviour of agents, then cultural attraction is a good candidate to explain evolution in this domain.
In itself, finding a cultural attractor is not an explanation, but an indication that the transmission biases are interacting in such a way that the state of culture is maintained in spite of important changes in micro-level transmission events.
Source selection is the umbrella process studied mostly under the Californian approach, and is an explanatory factor of evolution in domains that feature copying behaviours (i.e. transmission is high-fidelity):
when agents copy traits, or attempt to copy them, with for instance conformity, prestige, or content biases, then evolution can be usefully explored by looking at the way agents select the sources from which they copy, and the differential spread that entails.
Both source selection and attraction act on multiple scales, as cultural traits or elements can be copied and transformed on several dimensions that potentially interact.

As @acerbi_if_2015 note, attraction and source selection are not incompatible, as both are part of the overall cultural evolution process.
Given their multi-level nature, both processes can also be part of one another;
for instance, transformation at the level of a sentence can be analysed as selection at the level of words or concepts.
@sterelny_cultural_2017 also notes that the Parisian and Californian research streams differ mostly in what they aim to explain.
For the Californians, the question is how humans managed to survive and develop successful practices in the face of an opaque environment (for instance poisonous plants that, only if processed properly, can become highly nutritive).
They explain this by appealing to cumulative cultural learning, which allows agents to learn from the practices of their preceding generation by copying and slightly modifying them in the process.
Some level of imitation of copy is crucial to this account, precisely because the opacity and the dangerousness of the environment forbids the sort of self-confident experimenting one could observe without copy.
For the Parisians, the question is why cultural traditions with no clear utilitarian value can exist, and evolve, aside from survival-related practices such as cooking techniques.
They argue that the evolution of such traditions crucially involves ostensive communication (where the recipient of the communication must recognise the intention behind the communicative act), which is fidelity-neutral but not content-neutral:
not all pieces of content are communicated equally, and successful communication only rarely entails copy.
The Parisians thus ask why, in the face of a low-fidelity process that introduces such variation at every step, some cultural elements maintain a level of constancy and keep being transmitted through time, thus becoming evolving traditions.

If the two approaches aim to explain different features of culture, in which domain is each approach most appropriate?
Are there domains that involve both imitation and non-copying communication in important degrees?
How do the two processes interact in such cases?
These are the questions left open by recognising a complementarity between the Parisian and Californian approaches.


### Interaction of cultural and genetic evolution

Opinions on the importance of gene-culture co-evolution dynamics vary widely.
To what extent do genetic and cultural evolution interact, and in which cases does cultural change drive genetic change?
Niche construction theorists, and more broadly the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis movement, have convincingly argued for the relevance of such interactions in some specific cases, such as lactose tolerance.
Developmental systems theorists further argue that genetic material and culture in its broadest sense are part of a wider matrix of resources that participate in the growth of developmental systems, and are thus necessarily interacting.
Proponents of the Californian approach to cultural evolution broadly agree with the niche construction perspective, considering that the cultural processes they study (concerned more with norms than with traditions *per se*) can have a long-term impact on the selective niche in which later generations develop.
In particular, one view has it that the centrality of cultural transmission in human beings created a selective pressure for transmission capacities themselves [@sterelny_cultural_2017], such that cultural evolution drives genetic changes that enhance transmission.
While CAT is broadly compatible with a gene-culture co-evolution account, @morin_how_2016 is not convinced that this interaction is necessary to explain the emergence of global human traditions.
Indeed, he argues that faithful transmission itself is neither necessary nor sufficient to explain the diffusion of global traditions, and consequently that scenarios that do not involve genetic adaptation to imitation are just as plausible given the current evidence.

This question is intimately related to the relative importance of imitation and non-copying communication.
But answers might also lie in the importance and exact nature of the cognitive niche described by @sterelny_minds:_2010:
how does the construction of such niches contribute to both ecological and psychological (through scaffolding of cognitive development) factors of attraction as the Parisian stream views them?
How can the process of niche construction be usefully modelled to test hypotheses on the feedback dynamics between different channels of inheritance?
Here too much is open to explore, which leads us to the next point:
further development of empirical studies.


### Empirical attractors

Reliably defining and observing phenomena that qualify as cultural attractors in real life can be challenging, first and foremost because of the multi-level nature of culture, representations, and thus of attraction.
As @acerbi_if_2015 [p. 494] note, the definition of what counts as a cultural trait is not settled.
Should one focus on mental processes, on artefacts, or on both?
At what descriptive level of artefacts does one consider a transformation to be a meaningful cultural change, worthy of being considered as participating in a cultural attractor?
Take the much debated example of Cinderella:
any telling of that story will differ from other instances on dozens of features, which could all be taken to be significant in a particular context.
A change in prosody or in the choice of words might alter the overall feel of the story, but not its narrative structure.
A change in narrative style or structure, or an instantiation of the characters in a modern setting, might completely change the face of the story while maintaining the "persecuted heroine" aspect that tale classification systems attribute to Cinderella.
Telling the tale in a particular context or to certain people only, say for instance as an intimate bed-time story for one's child versus as a political metaphor in public discourse, can dramatically change the way it is received by its listeners.
Looking for, as it were, the information encoded in a version of the tale, or the representation it can elicit, only serves to postpone the problem one step further.
The nature of these effects is well recognised by most writings on CAT, and one way of tackling them could be using Relevance Theory [@sperber_relevance:_1995;@wilson_relevance_2004], an approach that integrates well with CAT and provides a framework to understand how agents can select salient dimensions of artefacts in a concrete communicative situation.
Nevertheless, treating this diversity in an empirical study, even if it is only by classifying levels to evaluate their isolated relevance, is very much an open question [even though @acerbi_if_2015 note that similar multi-level indetermination of the unit of analysis is also found in the study of genetics].

Second, as explained in @sec:intro-review-parisian, the scope of the phenomena to measure makes practical data collection also quite challenging.
Existing methods can be divided into the meta-analysis of large bodies of historical and anthropological works, laboratory transmission chains or micro-societies, and the analysis of digital traces, especially from social networks.
The expertise necessary to uncover reliable patterns using each of those methods makes higher integration a demanding task.
Nonetheless, there is much to gain by articulating these paradigms together, individually pushing them beyond their current limitations, and connecting them to studies in cognitive science.
Developing empirical methods is an integral part of any theoretical endeavour, and creating better observation tools is a sure path both to push theoretical issues forward, and open previously unavailable questions to exploration.

Identifying a cultural attractor in a specific domain also opens the question of the feedback loops it emerges from or participates in.
Indeed an attractor is expected to have effects on the ecological context from which it arises, since it changes the distribution of representations people are exposed to.
When psychological and ecological factors are involved in the emergence of the attractor, feedback effects are then to be expected.
How does an attractor participate to or transform its own context?
In which cases is that retroaction a factor in the emergence of the attractor, versus a side-effect?
For long-lived attractors, is this process a form of niche construction?

More generally, fleshing out the predictions that attraction makes in specific empirical cases and developing methods to test those situations will help bring the ideas underpinning CAT into sharper focus.
Much more empirical application is needed to evaluate the framework, and only such extensive testing in varied domains will determine how fruitful that approach is for the study of cultural evolution.


### Framework versus formal theory contrasted with alternatives

@sperber_explaining_1996 [p. 83] argues that CAT should not aim to become a "grand unitary theory", a position which is well informed by the diversity of domains CAT seeks to explain.
It also seems in accord with the variety of ways one can approach a single domain, as the Cinderella example reminds us.
Instead, CAT proposes a framework, a way of thinking that generates certain questions for the explanation of culture.
Nevertheless, the approach relies on two fundamental elements that provide some degree of unification.
First, Sperber insists on providing a clear ontology to the study of culture:
that of public and mental representations, the exact definition of the latter being delegated to works in cognitive science.
Second, part of CAT's argument for cultural attraction rests on the idea that much human communication is *ostensive* communication [@morin_how_2016, chap. 2], that is it works through the inference of communicative intentions, a process which involves a great deal of reconstruction.
Relevance Theory, in particular, is one contender for the detailed explanation of this mode of communication.
Given these two fundamentals, what prevents CAT theorists from developing an abstract but systematic mapping of communicative process to stylised phenomena, in a similar manner to the modelling endeavours of @boyd_culture_1985?
@sterelny_cultural_2017 [p. 49] notes indeed that no such systematic formal models have developed in the Parisian research stream [although some models have been developed, for instance @claidiere_role_2007; @claidiere_how_2014].

The challenge is precisely the formalisation of both representations and the context in which they are communicated and evolve.
While models need not reach this level of detail to be useful [indeed @claidiere_role_2007; and @claidiere_how_2014 propose higher-level models based on Evolutionary Causal Matrices], the richness of CAT lies principally with the recognition of an important role of cognition in cultural evolution, that is, of transformative and reconstructive processes.
Thus, constructing stylised, simple and tractable models for CAT without emptying the approach of its main contribution is a challenge the field has not yet overcome.
Classical cultural evolution, to the contrary, rests on imitative processes, such that models can avoid restrictions on the exact nature of a cultural trait and focus on its frequency or spread in a population, without having to worry too closely about mutation.
Not so for CAT:
a meaningful model of cultural attraction must account for representations and their transformations, up to a degree, but in a sufficiently general way to (1) elicit effects due to the added ingredient of transformation, (2) be applicable to different contexts.
@claidiere_role_2007 and @claidiere_how_2014 have developed the first steps of such an approach, with discrete or continuous one-dimensional representation spaces that already show that attraction can create behaviours not accounted for by imitation-only models.
The next step, however, is much higher, and is likely to involve a simple version of Relevance Theory, that is on one side an account of the multi-level and multi-dimensionality of representations, and on the other side a mechanism for agents to sieve through that added complexity.

While such an endeavour seems quite ambitious given the current state of modelling, it would provide a well-defined playing field to confront accounts of cultural evolution and the overall approach to cognition.
Indeed, as we have seen in @sec:intro-review-criticisms, defining the cognitive factor of cultural evolution in terms of representation processing (a view shared by CAT and Relevance Theory) is not the only option available;
one could imagine, for instance, a modification of CAT where the cognitive-level processes have been swapped out in favour of dynamical systems or enactive accounts of interactions.
Indeed, these approaches are also developing a description of the way organisms make sense of their world, a description which can come to replace the way organisms select and infer relevant information in their communications (in the terms of language of information processing approaches).

Clearly, modelling CAT has not yet been pushed to its limits, and for good reasons:
the challenges involved are considerable.
But developing this line, if successful, would be extremely promising for the confrontation of genuine alternatives to the approach of the role of cognition in cultural evolution.
