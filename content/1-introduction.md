# Introduction

## Old Outline

People attempt to unify cognitive science and the social sciences under the same theoretical umbrella.
Potential umbrellas are:

* CAT
* Copy-based cultural evolution
* Ingold's developmental systems theory-based approach

Empirical approaches to test these, for now, fall into three main approaches:

* Experimental transmission chains on simple content
* Compilation of historical works or data
* Social network data analysis

Each has its problems:

* Transmission chains are on excessively simple content
* Historical compilations miss the variety of situations (lose detail), and are hard-put to distinguish explanations
* Social network analysis doesn't look at cognitive factors

I suggest that, by combining the advantages of those approaches, and using current technology:

* We can test new questions
* Questions that were theoretical or unknown emerge as unavoidable

I aim to contribute two detailed case-studies to 1) show this, 2) bring a couple new results, 3) discuss the relevance of CAT for cultural evolution.

START SENTENCES
- reciprocal influences of cog and soc have a long history (in sociology and anthropology, today in cogsci)
- cultural evolution is a real battlefield nowadays
- the study of human is divided into many fields and ontologies

grand goals
- connect cog and soc, make accounts with the same ontology

starting questions
- does CAT capture cogsoc, or how much
- is CAT testable/falsifiable
- does CAT account for some realities
- does attraction/convergence exist

problems encountered
- level of description for convergence
- interpretation and meaning
- taking context into account
- from that, the representational fight

end questions
- how to turn those philosophical confrontations into empirical questions
- does including the criticisms into CAT not empty its substance, and if so where to go









The study of the human being is divided into many fields and, most importantly, ontologies.

- social science and cognitive science have always seemed like two sides of the same coin
- human beings are complex
- a rift divides the social and psychological sciences
- there have been many attempts to bring them back together

It is much too late to be pessimistic.

The theory of Epidemiology of Representations, or Cultural Attraction Theory as it has recently been renamed, proposes an approach to the synthesis of social science and cognitive science.

By proposing an ontology made essentially of representations, ... public/private ..., reformulate questions from anthropology in terms of the circulation of representations in society.

In this thesis I have made it my task to make an empirical and, when appropriate, critical contribution to the discussion of this theory.

To do so, I present the three broad steps I took over the course of my PhD. A first empirical study focused on the transformations that quotations undergo when authors copy them online from blog to media website to blog; a second study focused on the evolution of short utterances of different types in a controlled transmission chain setting; finally an in-depth evaluation of what such studies contribute to the field, the empirical challenges that their shortcomings reflect, and a discussion of how criticisms of CAT from social anthropology and enactive cognitive science can help understand those shortcomings.
