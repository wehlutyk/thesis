# Introduction

<!--
## Old Outline

People attempt to unify cognitive science and the social sciences under the same theoretical umbrella.
Potential umbrellas are:

* CAT
* Copy-based cultural evolution
* Ingold's developmental systems theory-based approach

Empirical approaches to test these, for now, fall into three main approaches:

* Experimental transmission chains on simple content
* Compilation of historical works or data
* Social network data analysis

Each has its problems:

* Transmission chains are on excessively simple content
* Historical compilations miss the variety of situations (lose detail), and are hard-put to distinguish explanations
* Social network analysis doesn't look at cognitive factors

I suggest that, by combining the advantages of those approaches, and using current technology:

* We can test new questions
* Questions that were theoretical or unknown emerge as unavoidable

I aim to contribute two detailed case-studies to 1) show this, 2) bring a couple new results, 3) discuss the relevance of CAT for cultural evolution.

START SENTENCES

- reciprocal influences of cog and soc have a long history (in sociology and anthropology, today in cogsci)
- cultural evolution is a real battlefield nowadays
- the study of human is divided into many fields and ontologies


LOCATE

- study of life is a never-ending explosion, with competing visions and changing views
- what are life and cognition, what are nature and culture, what is it to be human, how to describe and make the best "carving of joints" to explain the emergence, complexity, and evolution of life
- naturally there are dozens of disciplines involved, as there are dozens of facets that have been divided into as many areas
- for decades, people have tried to bring back the facets together, either as facets, or as levels of explanation
- recently several challengers have risen in several fields: cognitive science is at a crossroads, evolutionary biology also
- cultural evolution, which aims to bridge the two, is burgeoning, strengthening cognitive anthropology as the synthesis
- at stake in those debates is the overarching vision/paradigm of how facets fit together, which defines the set of obvious and difficult things, guides the design of new questions, experiments, and implementations.
- in that space, cognitive anthropology currently is the dominant approach to bringing all the facets together
- it has a number of variants, of which DIT and CAT, which seem to agree on the philosophical framing of things, but have open debates and differing focuses

- the particular question here is: observe actual phenomena, explain them. From there, what are the ways of accounting for all these phenomena in a unique framework, that will give intelligibility at high level, and guide further questions. What are the differences between the various approaches, and which approaches are viable.

- How could there be any problems, and how is this a real question, since it's all a matter of empiricism?
- First, the breadth of things you can look at is such that a theory will let you define what things are worth looking at
- Inside those things, some phenomena are not explained and we have a good idea of what could be the explanation
- Some other phenomena are not explained, and we have no idea how to tackle them, like the hard problem of content
- And the approach you take on those unsolved problems can be somewhat foundational for the rest of your theory, and makes other phenomena more or less natural to account for
- I don't claim to help with anything in the HPC. But I do think that existing theories can be moved forward by improving current empirical methods, to try and see how they pan out in relation to these hard problems.


FOCUS

- I will focus on CAT
- CAT, or ER, was developed by Sperber in the 90's, in a series of innovative articles
- explicitly not a reductionism, and not a Grand Unified Theory
- he proposes a general ontology where we think of things as representations, public/private that circulate, and that global dynamical system has attractors (that are more or less contingent on a situation in space and time)
- that lets us give an ontology for a framework, where we can rephrase long-standing anthropological questions in terms of spread of representations
- the hypothesis of attractors is the main added value of the theory: it claims that because of the interaction of biology, cognition, environment, and current cultural state, the space of how things evolve is somewhat skewed

- as can be understood by the recent name change, it's not clear that representations are the focus (e.g. distance when talking, or even the ClaidiÃ¨re & Sperber 2007 example of smoking). I believe the central intuition was that psychology, in the form of at-the-time-emerging cognitive science, has a rich part to play in any synthesis, and is a core ingredient in the appearance of attractors.
- indeed, that is what is emphasised in debates with DIT
- also, it is not an explanatory theory in the sense of quantum physics (as it's not a GUT): Sperber reminds us that finding an attractor is only a cue to looking for its underlying causes. Instead it's a way of thinking at a high level, like a philosophy maybe
- so in a way, it can't be proved or disproved. But it can be more or less fruitful in generating situations and ideas.

- my focus will be on bringing case studies of two types
- in-vivo, where there is huge complexity, but it's ecological
- in-vitro, where one can control the complexity a little, but you have to set a task and anything you do is subject to that choice
- and discuss the usefulness of CAT for those cases
- and show how developing these experiments helps show the pain-points and problems in CAT


ARGUE/EXPAND


OUTLINE




grand goals
- connect cog and soc, make accounts with the same ontology. That is the problem I fell in love with, and I'm trying to avoid falling in love with a solution.

starting questions
- does CAT capture cogsoc, or how much
- is CAT testable/falsifiable
- does CAT account for some realities
- does attraction/convergence exist: do we (and if so how so) transform meaning in a particular fashion given a particular situation, can such effects can be found, can they be somehow generalized

concrete goals
- make a little advance in one limited area: short utterances
- point out the flaws there
- map the options from there on

problems encountered
- the question of what information is, i.e. the information dualism of representations
  - -> level of description for convergence/transformation (can't decide on a principled level)
  - -> interpretation and meaning
- taking context & environment into account, which is tackled by RT and Niche Construction, although that may not be enough, as it can maintain the dualism of nature/culture (might follow from the information dualism), even if you believe that it started early in biological evolution

end questions
- how to turn those philosophical confrontations into empirical questions
- does including the criticisms into CAT not empty its substance, and if so where to go









The study of the human being is divided into many fields and, most importantly, ontologies.

- social science and cognitive science have always seemed like two sides of the same coin
- human beings are complex
- a rift divides the social and psychological sciences
- there have been many attempts to bring them back together

It is much too late to be pessimistic.

The theory of Epidemiology of Representations, or Cultural Attraction Theory as it has recently been renamed, proposes an approach to the synthesis of social science and cognitive science.

By proposing an ontology made essentially of representations, ... public/private ..., reformulate questions from anthropology in terms of the circulation of representations in society.

In this thesis I have made it my task to make an empirical and, when appropriate, critical contribution to the discussion of this theory.

To do so, I present the three broad steps I took over the course of my PhD. A first empirical study focused on the transformations that quotations undergo when authors copy them online from blog to media website to blog; a second study focused on the evolution of short utterances of different types in a controlled transmission chain setting; finally an in-depth evaluation of what such studies contribute to the field, the empirical challenges that their shortcomings reflect, and a discussion of how criticisms of CAT from social anthropology and enactive cognitive science can help understand those shortcomings.
