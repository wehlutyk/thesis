# Acknowledgements {-}

This work could not have been achieved without the continued support of my family, friends, and colleagues.
In particular, I am extremely grateful to my supervisors Camille Roth and Jean-Pierre Nadal, who offered unwavering encouragement and sympathy in all my explorations throughout these years, as well as regular and thorough evaluations of ongoing work and writings.

I additionally would like to thank Ana Sofia Morais for her precious advice on initial versions of @sec:brainscopypaste, as well as Telmo Menezes, Jean-Philippe Cointet, Sharon Peperkamp, Nicolas Claidi√®re and Nicolas Baumard for useful suggestions and comments on @sec:brainscopypaste and the work presented in @sec:gistr.

To all of you, thank you.
